I told them the greatest lie\\
that we might as well be a little too crazy\\
since the sun, and the moon, all will soon die\\
in the books they told me it is so\\
how I chase and yearn for more\\

the characters have poise meaning and directions\\
in this stage with no director tym\\
is still looking for more pages\\
arcs to follow and loves to be betrayed\\
meetings of young fellow of hearts and minds\\
on dinner tables under scarce yellow light bulb\\
at night, of course ---

where smoke flows slowly with no urgency\\
and scraps of paper are spreaded, unevenly\\
poetry, waiting to be written, where friends\\
assemble and the chitchatter reverberates\\
creativity and such bore me now\\
an outside is needed, to reveal what lies\\
in the pages yet to be written\\
