\section{prologue}
\label{sec:org15198fa}
\subsection{naked}
\label{sec:orga3c8c6a}
\begin{verse}
she sits, naked and alone; her shaped dimmed\\
by the low light of memory\\
my throat fills with a sob\\
I can see the river swallowing her\\
I am not that far, though I can't drive there\\
the bridge has been destroyed\\
the perpatrator has been found, found not guilty\\
afterwards, she is still lost, even more since\\
I crawled back into her life\\
we slept together just before the sun set\\
I told her to leave because she described my fears\\
most accurately, now the phone is dead\\
there is no use picking it up\\
I am only learning to try\\
to get a handle of the will to cling\\
\vspace*{1em}
I have lived a long time alone\\
and compressed a few fresh moments of togetherness\\
along the way, a crystallized kaleidoscope built\\
for memories as long as they which means I, last\\
\end{verse}

\subsection{tell me}
\label{sec:org1037f4b}
\begin{verse}
I used to think living is synonymous to thinking\\
what an obvious mistake\\
tell me your mommy issues\\
I'll tell you mine\\
the couch is littered with confettis \& cat hair\\
which I am allergic to, a mixed bag of a party if you ask me\\
there are better ways to mask the ennui\\
was it worth it If don't enjoy it\\
anymore, the thirst the quest for more\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{allergies}
\label{sec:org358f7ed}
\begin{verse}
the couch is comfortable, just enough\\
on it, tym sitting, with a cat on is lap\\
he is allergic to them yet gently pets it\\
gently he caresses the space between it's two ears\\
he knows it will itch later but so be it\\
the fabric is red velvet and carries the stains of time\\
coffee, hair and semen are woven together\\
in imperious textures and patterns\\
\vspace*{1em}
the meaning eludes, so sings the flute\\
arrogance is coming on a stranger's couch\\
without blushing or bluffing indifference\\
he sits idly, legs manspreaded for he is alone\\
\end{verse}
\section{at first}
\label{sec:org516aa81}
\subsection{envy}
\label{sec:org74a1e7a}
\begin{verse}
at the party\\
there weren't that many\\
people; the young man could\\
see what mattered; not himself\\
he could tell you that much\\
looking for softer mattresses\\
until he came about and\\
she had the eyes of his memory\\
the lies of his own imagination\\
bliss looked ever so distant\\
\vspace*{1em}
there was a table and six\\
or seven chairs; just enough\\
it wasn't raining yet\\
but you could feel it coming\\
with sparks and ozone holes\\
drifting above; choosing the signs\\
to follow seemed easy at first\\
\vspace*{1em}
but then again\\
envy was a twisted word\\
the hair was messy and the grapes\\
tasted good enough; his pulse ran\\
deep, beneath randomness and\\
artesian caves where the fish swim\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{aftermath}
\label{sec:org710eb86}
\begin{verse}
when they arrived at his parents house\\
the door was locked\\
so he had to force it\\
softly; and yet it cracked\\
it was cold outside afterall\\
he was in some kind of rush\\
there was no going back\\
after she kissed him\\
\vspace*{1em}
he couldn't tell who had\\
made the first move\\
thinking comes later\\
when you wish for the woman\\
of your dreams and\\
nightmares lose their meaning\\
the first word he could utter\\
was \textit{fuck}; all the hair was soft\\
even the close shaven one was golden\\
and sweet and her\\
underwear was near enough\\
so as to not forget the fault\\
\vspace*{1em}
because doors shouldn't\\
crack, they should swivel\\
and turn but he was in a rush\\
to see how far life should go\\
in those moments decisions\\
aren't what they seem\\
they just crack\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{cars}
\label{sec:org17133b1}
\begin{verse}
the waters are shallow\\
don't you know\\
you can't fly although\\
the feeling only shows when loneliness\\
seems deeper than a  night without.--\\
the insects stop buzzing our ears; ache\\
the pools are not vast enough to get lost in\\
your eyes, deeper than I could  imagine\\
I still call at 3am --- a dead phone\\
all we ever needed was a car ride\\
past midnight; when lights blur\\
and rain  could choose its own direction\\
just another word for speed\\
her quick witted smile could tame\\
the wildest eyebrows\\
\vspace*{1em}
her beauty needs  motion\\
like delicate clocks I could see her face\\
only by glimpsing across our\\
rift of emptiness\\
I wish I could promise\\
the waters are as shallow\\
as they sound but here\\
they refract my loneliness\\
in green grey shapes of tomorrow\\
\vspace*{1em}
The car is old the streets are filled\\
untill we get to the place\\
where streams lullaby us to sleep\\
and where nothing matters really\\
in the end peace was what\\
we were striving for\\
away from passion and envy\\
and where words only mean\\
what their face showed\\
\end{verse}
\section{absence}
\label{sec:orgc843070}
\subsection{pills}
\label{sec:org1fcfa79}
\begin{verse}
I'm in the corner of the room\\
not sure how space works anymore\\
I seem to hover, just a little,\\
above the tiled floor\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now you're laying asleep, content\\
with tamed eyes, absent from me\\
sheltered from me\\
they caressed your Hair\\
slipped the pill under your tongue\\
and whispered soft ``it's okay's''\\
here the windows are blurry with rain\\
glossing out construction cranes\\
--refracting the dying lights\\
\vspace*{1em}
The chairs were almost comfortable\\
and within their mutual angle\\
you only had to roll your eyes to\\
spray a distant stare\\
We used to have warm ashtrays\\
hot coffee,\\
cold feet; torn out socks\\
Scrambled eggs and \textit{fuck you weddings}\\
they caressed your hair\\
Slipped the pill under your tongue\\
and whispered their soft it's  okay's\\
\vspace*{1em}
You  should wake up and forget\\
but you slept remembering\\
they wear white coats\\
and indulgent airs\\
I will wear guilt and satisfation\\
when you woke up and remembered\\
I went for a long walk and you never came,\\
until much later, restoring some kind of faith\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{morning}
\label{sec:org916f294}
\begin{verse}
in the morning they found a naked\\
young man yelling atop its breath\\
``i didnt want to i swear i swear''\\
what are you rambling about --\\
said the older man\\
``does it matter, i swear I didn't,\\
want to'', then why did you; tym ?\\
"precisely what I'm trying to\\
figure out"; at last, he cried in the dark\\
\vspace*{1em}
The older man, reasonable\\
tried to talk some sense into\\
this lost soul\\
"can you rest a little at least, and slow down"\\
"you need"\\
"to slow--\\
down"\\
well yes but i cant promise\\
I won't eventually yell into your ear until it bursts,\\
I'm just trying to release\\
the older tears which are still stuck\\
or so experience tells me \&\\
Don't take me for a simple minded chump I\\
can see through your blinded logical scaffoldings\\
assembled for a building\\
you'll never meet\\
\vspace*{1em}
"Okay Tym sure, just remember to breath \ldots\\
I guess I just wish I knew why you\\
are still looking for meaning\\
where there is clearly none\\
but hear this:\\
after a while you'll find your way home\\
or towards something that looks like it\\
at the very least it will be inside \&\\
you look tired\\
so very tired of the outdoors"\\
\vspace*{1em}
in the night it was still\\
the same old story untill\\
an even older man asked tym\\
``why are you naked in the streets old sport''\\
I'm just looking for a mirror to spit into\\
"and what do I look like says you"\\
not a mirror I can tell you that much\\
and thus history repeated itself\\
\vspace*{1em}
but wherelse am I supposed to look, ---\\
we used to drive into sunsets holding hands and now\\
the sun rises on me and I still look for her shadow\\
I prefered to shine with her\\
"why aren't you with her then"\\
but old man why don't you get\\
it is precisely what I'm trying to figure out\\
"why can't you? you should be able to tell\\
one day youll know young man",\\
well i know one thing\\
I know it'll be too late\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{evening}
\label{sec:orge487c6b}
\begin{verse}
it is hard to say why\\
evenings hit the hardest\\
tym forgets, despite himself, at what time\\
the same old sun sets.\\
it slips by, eclipsed by the moon's signs\\
He just sits there, waits for a shadow\\
a silhouette of himself which is less shallow\\
muttering to himself; as for a prayer\\
``you were there when it mattered\\
something must have shattered''\\
and Tym hates rhyming couplets\\
\vspace*{1em}
actions are words sometimes; the\\
walls close in \& what else was tym left\\
with then but words words and words\\
he should heave learned: closed doors don't have to hurt\\
when you fold your clothes; \& the day\\
has been well spent\\
\vspace*{1em}
when it mattered I was chasing\\
instead of waiting, imitating ---\\
the tail never caught on to the trick\\
and now tym forgets the names of trees\\
\end{verse}
\section{also}
\label{sec:org279e248}
\subsection{here}
\label{sec:orgd1030e6}
\begin{verse}
here we can see; the winds\\
carry nothing into grey bliss\\
pale blue is not the color\\
we had chosen but it is ours\\
before we can hear our cries\\
the post man delivers\\
the cats get lost in alleyways\\
as soon as doors open\\
they come back to lick\\
their paws\\
gently\\
because whoever was in a rush\\
was gravely mistaken\\
\vspace*{1em}
the winds are hollow\\
we had chosen others and;\\
they carry nothing but empty smiles\\
of old varnish, where are the \textcolor{pink}{colors}\\
are they too old to be told?\\
pale blue wasn't supposed to\\
be the one \ldots at least it is cozy up there when\\
we can see the skies drifting\\
\vspace*{1em}
after we can see the limits\\
the employees punch in with weary eyes\\
discontent of their own desired cycles\\
and when they close doors\\
they don't double check the locks\\
because who would care\\
if one were to disappear\\
vanishing with hope\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{guilt}
\label{sec:orgf03040f}
\begin{verse}
as the postman came back\\
guilty of forgetting the sweetest package\\
an old man was looking for photographed\\
operands; right behind closed curtains\\
he should have looked under the couch\\
where our dreams used to live\\
they haven't  died they simply\\
chose new names such as\\
lotion cream and neons; flashing\\
and the sweetest apathy brings it back\\
whatever it was\\
\vspace*{1em}
we have to look for them\\
they hide well\\
beneath guilt they haven't died\\
they chose incense and flowers\\
we chose vodka and unskimmed milk\\
as the postman licked his paws\\
I lectured him on hygiene\\
national geographic would\\
have done it better for\\
it is objective\\
\vspace*{1em}
the new names sometimes\\
seem rather obtuse or strange\\
do not be alarmed by that fact\\
young man one day yellow will be blue\\
purple will be pink and an old order will be\\
restored; so to speak\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{brunch}
\label{sec:orged4c924}
\begin{verse}
he had a passionate love\\
and hate relationship with\\
some kinds of avocados\\
as If it were hard to\\
disentangle the vegan\\
ethics \& the many fruitful deaths\\
from them? whoever they were\\
brunches reeked of untainted privilege,\\
when you pay for the fact you\\
can eat before you are;\\
being actually fully awoke\\
\vspace*{1em}
on a related note he\\
dutifully (or so he thought?) preferred cold\\
left over coffees and desk computations\\
pre-urinal conversations; post coital\\
refreshed purity in all its\\
musky forms shapes and scents\\
where else what else could you find\\
in the internet days\\
such man is but a relay\\
and where else was he supposed to look for\\
the misty rains of a better year\\
\vspace*{1em}
\vspace*{1em}
\textit{but it has always been that way they yellled}\\
his eyes could say no more than\\
yes but even then: we had hope,\\
in the trees in the birds in the sun glows\\
now dissipated in the midst of blue fluocompact lights\\
how should one choose his own\\
lightbulb to read by\\
lost psalms and poems of soft beautiful agony\\
\end{verse}
\section{far}
\label{sec:org22e1b69}
\subsection{how so}
\label{sec:org237247f}
\begin{verse}
relativity is a strange word\\
when far feels very much alive\\
some people spend lives measuring\\
osculating; spending thrift change\\
to get neat answers like\\
6 foot three and barry is an asshole\\
but really who knows\\
maybe he was a nice guy in the end\\
we know dwelling on it doesn't do\\
\vspace*{1em}
because quite simply\\
being sometimes is not enough\\
I still crave for those answers,\\
I could stop if\\
the cat would stop getting inside\\
but it always finds a crack a crevisse\\
strangers who are without a room have a past\\
and will always curl inwards searching for true memories\\
unfucked with, the presence of the real\\
behind the blossoms of gardens\\
planted for the sake of time\\
well spent\\
\vspace*{1em}
now tell me\\
do you like my new haircut\\
I told the barber\\
to remind me of me\\
I think he did a swell job\\
untill someone asked me how was my acting career\\
doing, well screw you and your pictures\\
your  well adjusted\\
routines is what I told the chump\\
now I'm left with bitterness\\
of my own making and two birds$\backslash$\\
they won't stop shitting just\\
just besides the cage\\
now can god make a good metaphor of that\\
because I'm tired and it was a nice couch\\
the winds are stronger than I thought\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{enough}
\label{sec:org7176809}
\begin{verse}
as tym crossed the street\\
he saw two cars of different\\
shades pass by him\\
he waltzed and gave a hard\\
stare at the cat\\
peering over closed curtains\\
he couldn't choose\\
which one\\
\vspace*{1em}
so he strolled passed\\
to find some shade in\\
the orchard where knowledge\\
at least is not frowned upon\\
he found a place where windows\\
exist, however inside is still different\\
outside is colder and gray\\
inside is cozy and pale red\\
you might catch a glimpse\\
but for that you need to choose your\\
waking hours\\
\vspace*{1em}
the difference is slim\\
it might be a slight wind draught\\
or the echo of a lover with broken arms\\
are they still useful? why yes of course!\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{waiting}
\label{sec:org38a8360}
\begin{verse}
pale blue wasn't supposed\\
to be our color; in the great\\
beauty of it all I still catch it\\
the myself looking at ceilings\\
looking for company\\
\vspace*{1em}
someday she slept  in like a tempest\\
left no room for apathy\\
which used to be sweet\\
\& so it gave way to restlesness\\
where writing is for publishers\\
and tides only come in\\
when the horoscopes tell them so\\
\vspace*{1em}
tym never travelled enough\\
he preferred the confines of his own mind\\
--- peeking for lightness\\
and as was foretold he found\\
choosing your prison\\
is simply a matter of semantics;\\
rethorically speaking\\
\end{verse}
\section{nicotine}
\label{sec:org58fa7d4}
\subsection{the last one}
\label{sec:orgf31ed43}
\begin{verse}
the last one can be hard to digest\\
you will play with it  and ignore\\
the rest a little, tym but always\\
let time work \& remember why you came here\\
you had \textit{reasons} and\\
\textit{objectives}\\
\vspace*{1em}
can you at least\\
hum, tell me what they were\\
because to me it felt quite simply\\
like licking my paws\\
and strolling through a different\\
parallax; for it be to leveled\\
\vspace*{1em}
well first of all tym\\
you need to stop\\
hiding behind all those words\\
they will bite --- and hurt you back\\
those games are not meant\\
to be played by the score\\
otherwise you will crack\\
and the cats will come back\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{uncertainty}
\label{sec:org4fd30c5}
\begin{verse}
but now tell me\\
how long should I wait\\
as long as it takes they say\\
but that just adds to the smell\\
of deja vu, which is good\\
it also hurts though\\
\vspace*{1em}
it will hurt as long as\\
you don't understand\\
the point, and keep looking\\
for the lines, the sharp ones\\
the diagonals -- ;\\
they go too deep for your\\
young heart you should, stick to parallel\\
parking and learn it good,\\
\vspace*{1em}
hear me out; unlearn the smoke\\
and the release in cycles\\
for tomorrow is just the same\\
what should you claim for it\\
to be different? -- now don't\\
make me laugh, my back still hurts\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{sleep}
\label{sec:org08386f5}
\begin{verse}
tym went to his bed and looked for sleep\\
where there is none\\
as was foretold, but now think\\
why should it be there when you look\\
for the absence --\\
he opened a book; and threw it out\\
\vspace*{1em}
then another one\\
and the process went on\\
turning over maybe towards some\\
parallax of lost years\\
which; was fidgeting with his memory\\
when eyelids become the last\\
frontier of beauty,\\
rolling above restfulness\\
and so he remembered tom's advice\\
\vspace*{1em}
you need to stop fidgeting tym\\
it won't help no one\\
sit still and un-arch your back\\
focus on some task otherwise you know well;\\
in old age it will come back to haunt you\\
your posture I mean, lying down while the world wakes\\
can be often a cowardly act\\
\end{verse}
\section{moving}
\label{sec:org00e52fd}
\subsection{somewhere}
\label{sec:org6da96a2}
\begin{verse}
sieves are the hardest to knit\\
you need patience and wit\\
some of the musics looses magic\\
when frontiers define the tragic\\
blank verse is for cowards\\
free is even worse, so shouted\\
the post modern man\\
\vspace*{1em}
intrinsic to the goal are the river's shores\\
you need synthetic clothings\\
canoes and devices, the wind won't push you\\
only if you let it fall,\\
only then will space fill the fields\\
acting on a distance is not how they work\\
they're simply there, osculating the waves\\
\vspace*{1em}
when tym reached for another book,\\
he opened it at random, or so he tried\\
signs and patterns were still there\\
for the first line told him of his own mistakes\\
do not try to let it go to waste\\
the land will not let signs unsused\\
in the shadow of the crane\\
at each waking hour we can see each other\\
getting built from small parts, bits at a time\\
some cities are bigger than others\\
getting lost is an art hard to practice\\
you need highways and tall buildings\\
tym preferred the comfort of knowing\\
exactly and precisely the wrong things\\
\end{verse}

\subsection{horizon}
\label{sec:orgdbb913c}
\begin{verse}
here the winds are clear\\
the flatness conjures something else\\
which cannot be fathomed;\\
the soft ripple of the stems\\
caress the horizons\\
\vspace*{1em}
fuzzyness is hard to define\\
yet you can feel it in empty mornings\\
we flash and yearn yet are bored\\
like Henry tym was lost between gripes\\
yet looked onwards towards fields\\
of yellow tranquil hills\\
\vspace*{1em}
do not go off chasing it\\
it will only leave you panting\\
tym needs to walk, resilience\\
hard stares and empty air\\
is where you'll find peace\\
was said before sometimes\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{distance}
\label{sec:org163107b}
\begin{verse}
the coffee was cold\\
and so was the trail\\
of some lost details; hidden\\
perhaps, beneath all the rest\\
which was laid bare to see\\
\vspace*{1em}
with binoculars for eyes\\
weren't enough; they were hard angles\\
and soft touches to find that night\\
the young man glimpsed at what was left\\
of his well sketched future\\
\vspace*{1em}
she was dancing and didn't care\\
he was drinking for the courage\\
it didn't come; why would it\\
all the people were celebrating\\
reasons and meanings, while tym\\
rested his elbows, concentrating\\
\end{verse}
\section{choices}
\label{sec:orgc8f7113}
\subsection{beginnings}
\label{sec:orgbfecbd2}
\begin{verse}
do not go off chasing\\
finding is easier when you let it\\
waltz and dance at a distance\\
moreover the touch is softer to those\\
who, unlike tym, can wait to be blessed\\
and are able to see the fuzzy winds\\
piercing through some of the deeper analogies\\
\vspace*{1em}
they cannot be predicted\\
and even if they could\\
why would they come\\
behind the bridge next to its shadow\\
where the pebbles are dirty\\
but the waters still flow, underanged\\
\vspace*{1em}
you can cast one if you feel like it\\
the faster the better probably ---\\
let them spin, the axis is your choice\\
tym felt a chore out of being amongst\\
so many rocks, where should he sit?\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{textures}
\label{sec:org8b65782}
\begin{verse}
this day the air is porous\\
and I can feel the sun\\
sliding down across the\\
reaches of your skin\\
I've never known why we were\\
looking across the same\\
pale landscapes;\\
but I couln't reach your hand\\
and chain our memories\\
to anchors of distant bliss\\
\vspace*{1em}
the ice cream cone\\
reflected your yesterdays ---;\\
joy, untamed yet in your eyes\\
I let the clouds gently slide\\
caressing what was left of\\
my palms\\
\vspace*{1em}
you were there, behind the tree\\
I could not walk in the same tracks\\
so I drifted, downwards to the same\\
old circles of me where sense ends\\
and new beginnings were there to find\\
\end{verse}

\subsection{magic}
\label{sec:orgf6cfc76}
\begin{verse}
from the other side of the street\\
where the trees crack at nights\\
is where you'll find it\\
the magic; splitting ever --\\
in corals and roots\\
and wonder why are you still looking so far\\
when what is harboured is also\\
always within reach for the delicate hand\\
\vspace*{1em}
you can let it fall\\
or try to grasp at the stems\\
catch you breath however\\
going fast makes no distinction\\
in the great beauty of it all\\
speed is simply one of those details\\
\vspace*{1em}
stopping has many synonyms\\
like loving for an instant\\
so tym --- please don't go off running like that\\
it is here; all around you\\
tom why the hell do you think ? \&\\
thus this is precisely why I keep going\\
in circles of restlessness, I would ve thought\\
and educated man such as yourself\\
would comprehend such things\\
\end{verse}
\section{night}
\label{sec:orgdc6e9c5}
\subsection{the street}
\label{sec:orge079154}
\begin{verse}
sitting on brick made stairs\\
the street was empty apart\\
from a couple parked cars\\
and the ruffle in the leaves\\
while lets not forget the light\\
\vspace*{1em}
buzzing from high ways\\
lampposts could hide the sky\\
teeming up with refreshed trees\\
tym wondered where they all went\\
\vspace*{1em}
however it didn't matter\\
his location was enough\\
and well found amongst\\
other urbanites looking for\\
some peace, elsewhere; maybe\\
of fresh quiet in the humid air\\
yesterday it was\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{trees}
\label{sec:org25f6e68}
\begin{verse}
they split everso\\
and try to reach, higher\\
than where we led them\\
trees are the balance, arborescence\\
we were looking for before growing up\\
now they simply hang, content of their\\
own rustlin in the wind\\
\vspace*{1em}
tym stretched his legs\\
laid back in the chair, admiring\\
there was finally no point in moving\\
the leaves were doing it for him\\
epiphanies are too fast\\
he needs slow pulses of dancing\\
\vspace*{1em}
around his mind, a haircut maybe\\
but not today, he prefers the rustle\\
and the breeze that precedes it\\
something one cannot predict\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{wind}
\label{sec:org530affa}
\begin{verse}
it can be hard to adjust\\
to the speed at which it travels\\
choosing an angle to deflect\\
the hard winds of plains and mountains\\
they travel without warning\\
\vspace*{1em}
so he sat in diagonals to it\\
\& and he never saw the instinct\\
to move, restlessness is in the small moments\\
where why can he not\\
let it go let it be\\
\vspace*{1em}
it needs to be bottled first\\
and filtered, like sparkly springs\\
he flirts with apathy once again\\
only it has no movement\\
its water is murky\\
speed is essential, eventhough\\
we all know it to be relative\\
\end{verse}
*
\section{after}
\label{sec:orgd7a211a}
\subsection{endings}
\label{sec:org92fa26f}
\begin{verse}
when axioms fall,  let them sit tym\\
open them up in new spheres where beginnings\\
and endings stop in the wonder\\
apathy needs room to grow\\
-- \& blossom into new presents\\
\vspace*{1em}
spaces are chained to the times\\
where life meant more than the words\\
they tend to get lost in the details\\
into the featherly rustle which can wait\\
it will try to escape\\
\vspace*{1em}
the futures of yesterday are long gone\\
and remember them after they pass\\
the links are soft to those who\\
have the touch, delicate and effervescent\\
\end{verse}
\subsection{loneliness}
\label{sec:orga44b5a1}
\begin{verse}
you need to be able to bear the loneliness of the nights\\

there will be silence in the great apathy of stillness\\
those are lands to be explored, and left, uncharted\\
sometimes I fail and I wish there was another way\\
to drift and let the pieces fall together without intent\\
\vspace*{1em}
but the night is everywhere; \& so are you\\
I could never dislodge you from there\\
and never wanted to; I head your voice in\\
the distant echo of lost cars\\
and even more so in the one of those who have finally found their way\\
across the city there are so many of them, they chant your voice,\\
quietly, the rustle won't stop, why would it?\\

that we might as well be a little too crazy\\
since the sun, and the moon, all will soon die\\
in the books they told me it is so\\
how I chase and yearn for more\\
\vspace*{1em}
the characters have poise meaning and directions\\
in this stage with no director tym\\

arcs to follow and loves to be betrayed\\
meetings of young fellow of hearts and minds\\
on dinner tables under scarce yellow light bulb\\
at night, of course ---\\
\vspace*{1em}
where smoke flows slowly with no urgency\\
and scraps of paper are spreaded, unevenly\\
poetry, waiting to be written, where friends\\
assemble and the chitchatter reverberates\\

could nourrish loneliness with some depth of feeling\\
I had to put on my blue sweater\\
and turn the machine on\\
\vspace*{1em}
it rumbles smoothly, trying to concoct a lullaby\\
all I have are my memories of her's\\
the disjuncted ex's, whom i mesh in a fabric to sleep with\\
lay quietly under them, while the ill will whispers\\
tonight reality read from books sounds more concrete\\
more anchored, as if life prefers having some frame of reference\\
to circumscribe our confused airs of loneliness\\
\vspace*{1em}
If only I learned of the difference between inside \& outside\\
maybe, then, I could really lie next to you\\
always I thought I needed but so little\\
and here I am, wishing your presence, knowing I need it\\
yet should not, there are other ways tym they said\\
they are hard to find, I'll keep looking\\

where the lake ends and the creek begins\\
the silence was punctured by acoustic guitars\\
and distant laughter, applying new layers to\\
the sound of water claping on the riverbank\\
speeches are ignored, we preferred the crackling of the fire\\
\vspace*{1em}
best not meddle with inner peace maybe finally\\
reached, here, no need to tell the hard beautiful truths\\
they gleam, spark and dance around the ambers\\
and the fat drips from the chicken to the fire\\
through the blessed grill\\
\vspace*{1em}
meals are shared instinctively\\
the nearest guitar plays blues which is alright\\
until a pop tune can be recognized whence eyebrows are raised\\
there is reefer, maybe too much of it, who can tell ---\\
in the nightsky; what truths seem concealed from sane eyes\\
we are lacking bourbon and\\
here they simply ripple and glide slowly\\
over the canvas of our half shared tents\\

emboldened by mystical belonging\\
the certainty of spirit was my mistress\\
yet I come back to you, my eternal wife\\
to sleep in the warm bed of tender laughter\\
\vspace*{1em}
and yes if you ask I'm\\
still looking for the right emotion to wear\\
fashions are hard to follow so I linger\\

did not know who else to call\\
I couldn't find another thread to pull\\
to hitch myself back in reality\\
I ask too much of you, that much I know\\
yet what can I do, now that it's obvious\\
your eyes into mine meant solace when it mattered\\

on a hot Friday afternoon\\
My teeth are sharp you say\\
well it doesn't feel that way to me\\
I've been here before\\
what you call sharpness\\
I see as restlessness\\
\vspace*{1em}
Yes it is true\\
I can tear into people\\
but it is rage that you will feel\\
when exhausted I retreat into my mind\\
container of mysteries, I do not wish to explore\\
yet here I am, with my miner's headlamp\\
crawling into the crevisses, looking for a sharp end\\
\vspace*{1em}
Life is a game and I play the role of man\\
therefore I don't believe in stars\\
or the moon, only the sun\\
has stories to me\\
and I'm tired and looking for shade\\
Call me a genius and I'll come running\\
Call me a madman and I'll come running\\
Call me a lover and I'll go running\\
to the sea, to wash my memories in the cold flows\\
of a mind\\
well contained\\

\subsection{the performance of hiding}
\label{sec:org1ffd8fc}
\begin{verse}
I must confess a couple things\\
but first I wonder what can the stars\\
possibly say\\
to comfort the raw nerves where so much happens\\
silence is not the disease\\
in any case; inner chatter makes for much worse symptoms\\
that I can guarantee\\
I hear your voice modulating and I'm still\\
peaking at hidden meanings when I shouldn't\\
I must emphasize\\
prophets are the loneliest people you could find\\
looking for themselves they fall into the mirror\\
and call it god, think themselves musicians\\
of the world's noise which doesn't need\\
our interpretations, just listening should suffice\\
\vspace*{1em}
I must confess I do not enjoy\\
seeing my name on the page,\\
even the digital one\\
I have a weak sense of self\\
or so someone with a degree on the wall told me\\
rather I'd like to hide beneath layers of performances\\
Escher's dilemnas reduced to a simple conclusion\\
simply; I am not here.\\
Once I met a cultured man\\
soon to be husband of a woman who\\
still warms my heart by embracing me, loudly, before him.\\
We were at a mutual friend's wedding\\
and while they were doing some\\
quick bumps in the parking lot\\
commenting on love I told him\\
"as a learned man you must surely know\\
romanticism is a death cult", he smiled and agreed,\\
her embrace still warms my heart\\
\vspace*{1em}
I must confess I can still hear the stars sometimes\\
and feel them pulling me into the night sky\\
asking me to speak on their behalf\\
now I know where that road leads\\
I'd rather walk the silent path\\
where I can still hear the echoes\\
of the love that pulled me back\\
