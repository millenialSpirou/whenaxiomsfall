air conditionning and clean white tiled showerooms\\
are where tym finds himself, comforted by the white noise\\
of strange places where there is no one to mirror his longings\\
he needs stillness in the cold artificial air\\
the flickerings reach the right frequencies\\
60 hz is the number I think old man\\
ah yes but you need to inhale deeper tym\\

let it reach its zenith before you scale down\\
the mountain of lonely nights, I hope you know\\
by now that going down is harder than climbing up\\
and windows closed will teach you independence\\
of nature and of self, cut yourself from your fins\\
and reach for more more and more until less is undefined\\


I thought you were a sophisticated fellow\\
who enjoys poems, walks in the woods and smokez the pipes\\
now stop playing with cigarettes, you'll burn your fingers\\
``no this is not how it \textit{went}'', I can almost guarantee\\
