where the lake ends and the creek begins\\
the silence was punctured by acoustic guitars\\
and distant laughter, applying new layers to\\
the sound of water claping on the riverbank\\
speeches are ignored, we preferred the crackling of the fire\\

best not meddle with inner peace maybe finally\\
reached, here, no need to tell the hard beautiful truths\\
they gleam, spark and dance around the ambers\\
and the fat drips from the chicken to the fire\\
through the blessed grill\\

meals are shared instinctively\\
the nearest guitar plays blues which is alright\\
until a pop tune can be recognized whence eyebrows are raised\\
there is reefer, maybe too much of it, who can tell --- \\
in the nightsky; what truths seem concealed from sane eyes\\
we are lacking bourbon and 
here they simply ripple and glide slowly\\
over the canvas of our half shared tents\\
