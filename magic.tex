from the other side of the street\\
where the trees crack at nights\\
is where you'll find it\\
the magic; splitting ever --\\
in corals and roots\\
and wonder why are you still looking so far\\
when what is harboured is also\\
always within reach for the delicate hand\\

you can let it fall\\
or try to grasp at the stems\\
catch you breath however\\
going fast makes no distinction\\
in the great beauty of it all\\
speed is simply one of those details\\

stopping has many synonyms\\
like loving for an instant\\
so tym --- please don't go off running like that\\
it is here; all around you\\
tom why the hell do you think ? \& \\
thus this is precisely why I keep going\\
in circles of restlessness, I would ve thought\\
and educated man such as yourself\\
would comprehend such things\\
