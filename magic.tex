across the street from the tree\\
is where you'll find it\\
the magic; splitting ever --\\
in corals and roots\\
why are you still looking so far\\
when what is harboured is also\\
always within reach\\

you can let it fall\\
or try to grasp at the stems\\
catch you breath however\\
going fast makes no distinction\\
in the great beauty of it all\\
speed is simply one of those details\\

stopping has many synonyms\\
like loving for an instant\\
tym please don't go off running like that\\
it is here; all around you\\
tom why the hell do you think\\
this is precisely why I keep going\\
in circles of restlessness
