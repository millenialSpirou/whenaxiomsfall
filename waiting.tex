pale blue wasn't supposed\\
to be our color; in the great\\
beauty of it all I still catch it\\
the myself looking at ceilings\\
looking for company\\

someday she slept  in like a tempest\\
left no room for apathy\\
which used to be sweet\\
\& so it gave way to restlesness\\
where writing is for publishers\\
and tides only come in\\
when the horoscopes tell them so\\

tym never travelled enough\\
he preferred the confines of his own mind\\
--- peeking for lightness\\
and as was foretold he found\\
choosing your prison\\
is simply a matter of semantics; \\
rethorically speaking
