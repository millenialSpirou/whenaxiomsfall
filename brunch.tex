and hate relationship with\\
some kinds of avocados\\
as If it were hard to\\
disentangle the vegan\\
ethics \& the many fruitful deaths\\
from them? whoever they were\\
brunches reeked of untainted privilege,\\

the misty rains of a better year\\

yes but even then : we had hope,\\
in the trees in the birds in the sun glows\\
now dissipated in the midst of blue fluocompact lights\\
how should one choose his own\\
lightbulb\\
