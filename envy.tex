at the party\\
there weren't that many\\
people; the young man could\\
see what mattered; not himself\\
he could tell you that much\\
looking for softer mattresses\\
until he came about and\\
she had the eyes of his memory\\
the lies of his own imagination\\
bliss looked ever so distant\\

there was a table and six\\
or seven chairs; just enough\\
it wasn't raining yet\\
but you could feel it coming\\
with sparks and ozone holes\\
drifting above; choosing the signs\\
to follow seemed easy at first\\

but then again\\
envy was a twisted word\\
hair was messy and the grapes\\
tasted good enough; his pulse ran\\
deep, beneath randomness and\\
artesian caves where the fish swim\\
