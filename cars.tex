the waters are shallow\\
don't you know\\
you can't fly although\\
the feeling only shows when loneliness\\
seems deeper than a  night without.-- \\
the insects stop buzzing our ears; ache\\
the pools are not vast enough to get lost in\\
your eyes, deeper than I could  imagine\\
still call at 3am --- a dead phone\\
all we ever needed was a car ride\\
past midnight; when lights blur\\
and rain  could choose its own direction\\
just another word for speed\\
her quick witted smile could tame\\
the wildest eyebrows\\

her beauty needs  motion\\
like delicate clocks I could see her face\\
only by glimpsing across our\\
rift of emptiness\\
I wish I could promise\\
the waters are as shallow\\
as they sound but here\\
they refract my loneliness\\
in green grey shapes of tomorrow\\

The car is old the streets are filled\\
untill we get to the place\\
where streams lullaby us to sleep\\
and where nothing matters really\\
in the end peace was what\\
we were striving for\\
away from passion and envy\\
and where words only mean\\
what they meant
