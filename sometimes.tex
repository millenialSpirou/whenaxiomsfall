sometimes all you need is an anchor\\
like a cold glass of water\\
as the echo is distant and vast\\
moving needs answers to last\\


because time itches, I need, tom, you to imagine\\
to prevent the itching to turn into scratching\\
for that I threw it off the ship\\
and let the chains slowly drift\\
I didnt know where it would lead them\\

the sea was of that pale grey\\
which confounds the blessed\\
and leads the wretched\\
where to? it should not matter\\
for stability is what we're looking for
