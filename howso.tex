relativity is a strange word\\
when far feels very much alive\\
some people spend lives measuring\\
osculating; spending thrift change\\
to get neat answers like\\
6 foot three and barry is an asshole\\
but really who knows\\
maybe he was a nice guy in the end\\
we know dwelling on it doesn't do\\

because quite simply\\
being sometimes is not enough\\
I still crave for those answers, \\
I could stop if\\
the cat would stop getting inside\\
but it always finds a crack a crevisse\\
strangers who are without a room have a past\\
and will always curl inwards searching for true memories\\
unfucked with, the presence of the real\\
behind the blossoms of gardens\\
planted for the sake of time\\
well spent\\

now tell me\\
do you like my new haircut\\
I told the barber\\
to remind me of me\\
I think he did a swell job\\
untill someone asked me how was my acting career\\
doing, well screw you and your pictures\\
your  well adjusted\\
routines is what I told the chump\\
now I'm left with bitterness\\
of my own making and two birds\
they won't stop shitting just\\
just besides the cage\\
now can god make a good metaphor of that\\
because I'm tired and it was a nice couch\\
the winds are stronger than I thought
