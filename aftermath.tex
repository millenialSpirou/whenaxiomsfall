when they arrived at his parents house\\
the door was locked\\
so he had to force it\\
ever so gently; and yet it cracked\\
it was cold outside afterall\\
there was no going back\\
after she kissed him\\

he couldn't tell who had\\
made the first move\\
thinking comes later\\
when you wish for the woman\\
of your dreams and\\
nightmares lose their meaning\\
the first word he could utter\\
was \textit{fuck}; all the hair was soft\\
even the close shaven one was golden\\
and sweet; she slept with it and her\\
underwear was near enough\\
so as to forget the fault\\

because doors shouldn't\\
crack, they should swivel\\
and turn but he was in a rush\\
to see how far life should go\\
in those moments decisions\\
aren't what they seem\\
they crack\\
ever so gently
