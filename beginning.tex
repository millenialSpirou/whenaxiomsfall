do not go off chasing it\\
finding is easier; let it scroll\\
the touch is softer to those\\
who, unlike tym, can be waiting to be blessed\\
and can see the fuzzy\\
winds piercing deeper analogies\\

they cannot be predicted\\
and even if they could\\
would you come behind the bridge\\
where the pebbles are dirty\\
but the waters still flow, underanged\\

you can cast one if you feel like it\\
the more the faster the better\\
let them spin, the axis is your choice\\
tym felt a chore out of being amongst\\
so many rocks, where should he sit
