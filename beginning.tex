do not go off chasing\\
finding is easier when you let it\\
waltz and dance at a distance\\
moreover the touch is softer to those\\
who, unlike tym, can wait to be blessed\\
and are able to see the fuzzy winds \\
piercing through some of the deeper analogies\\

they cannot be predicted\\
and even if they could\\
why would they come\\
behind the bridge next to its shadow\\
where the pebbles are dirty\\
but the waters still flow, underanged\\

you can cast one if you feel like it\\
the faster the better probably ---\\
let them spin, the axis is your choice\\
tym felt a chore out of being amongst\\
so many rocks, where should he sit?
