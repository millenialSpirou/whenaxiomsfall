you need to be able to bear the loneliness of the nights\\
to find peace in the winds and waves of your own mind\\
even and maybe especially if it makes your soul shriek\\
it won't crack, in the deep there is no one but yourself\\

landing is easy as long as intoxication doesn't go too far\\
there will be silence in the great apathy of stillness\\
those are lands to be explored, and left, uncharted\\
sometimes I fail and I wish there was another way\\
to drift and let the pieces fall together without intent\\

but the night is everywhere; \& so are you\\
I could never dislodge you from there\\
and never wanted to; I head your voice in\\
the distant echo of lost cars\\
and even more so in the one of those who have finally found their way\\
across the city there are so many of them, they chant your voice,
quietly, the rustle won't stop, why would it?
