but now tell me\\
how long should I wait\\
as long as it takes they say\\
but that just adds to the smell\\
of deja vu, which is good\\
it also hurts though\\

it will hurt as long as\\
you don't understand\\
the point, and keep looking\\
for the lines, the sharp ones\\
the diagonals -- ;\\
they go too deep for your\\
young heart you should, stick to parallel\\
parking and learn it good,\\

hear me out; unlearn the smoke\\
and the release in cycles\\
for tomorrow is just the same\\
what should you claim for it\\
to be different? -- now don't\\
make me laugh, my back still hurts
