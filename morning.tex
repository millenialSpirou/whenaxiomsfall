in the morning they found a naked \\
young man yelling atop its breath\\
``i didnt want to i swear i swear'' \\
what are you rambling about --\\
said the older man\\
``does it matter, i swear I didn't,\\
want to'', then why did you; tym ?\\
precisely what I'm trying to \\
figure out; at last, he cried in the dark\\

can we talk at least, but less\\
well yes but i cant promise\\
I won't yell it into your ear until it bursts,\\
a young man is just trying to release\\
the older waters which are still stuck\\
experience tells me \&\\
one can see through your blinded logical scaffolding's\\
I guess I just wish I knew why you\\
are still looking for meaning\\
where there is clearly none\\
but hear this: \\
at the very least it will be inside \& \\



you look tired of outdoors\\
in the night it was still \\
the same old story untill\\
an even older man asked the even younger man \\
``why are you naked in the streets old sport''\\
I'm just looking for a mirror to spit into\\
and what do I look like says you \\
not a mirror I can tell you that much\\
and thus history repeated itself\\

but wherelse am I supposed to look, ---\\
we used to drive into sunsets holding hands and now\\
the sun rises on me but its lonely\\
I prefered to to shine with her\\
why aren't you with her then\\
but old man why don't you get\\
it is precisely what I'm trying to figure out\\
I still cry to marc ribot's guitar you see?\\
why can't you? you should be able to tell\\
one day youll know young man,
well i know one thing\\
I know itll be too late\\
