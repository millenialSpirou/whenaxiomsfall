they split everso\\
and try to reach, higher\\
than where we led them\\
trees are the balance, arborescence\\
we were looking for before growing up\\
now they simply hang, content of their\\
own rustlin in the wind\\

tym stretched his legs\\
laid back in the chair, admiring\\
there was finally no point in moving\\
the leaves were doing it for him\\
epiphanies are too fast\\
he needs slow pulses of dancing\\

around his mind, a haircut maybe\\
but not today, he prefers the rustle\\
and the breeze that precedes it\\
something one cannot predict\\
