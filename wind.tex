it can be hard to adjust\\
to the speed at which it travels\\
choosing an angle to deflect\\
the hard winds of plains and mountains\\
they travel without warning\\

so he sat in diagonals to it\\
\& and he never saw the instinct\\
to move, restlessness is in the small moments\\
where why can he not\\
let it go let it be\\

it needs to be bottled first\\
and filtered, like sparkly springs\\
he flirts with apathy once again\\
only it has no movement\\
its water is murky\\
speed is essential, eventhough\\
we all know it to be relative
