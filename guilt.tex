as the postman came back\\
guilty of forgetting the sweetest package\\
an old man was looking for photographed\\
operands; right behind closed curtains\\
he should have looked under the couch\\
where our dreams used to live\\
they haven't  died they simply\\
chose new names such as\\
lotion cream and neons; flashing\\
and the sweetest apathy brings it back\\
whatever it was\\

we have to look for them\\
they hide well\\
beneath guilt they haven't died\\
they chose incense and flowers\\
we chose vodka and unskimmed milk\\
as the postman licked his paws\\
I lectured him on hygiene\\
national geographic would\\
have done it better for\\
it is objective\\

the new names sometimes\\
seem rather obtuse or strange\\
do not be alarmed by that fact\\
young man one day yellow will be blue\\
purple will be pink and an old order will be\\
restored; so to speak
