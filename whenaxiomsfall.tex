\section{prologue}

\subsection{naked}
she sits, naked and alone; her shaped dimmed\\
by the low light of memory\\
my throat fills with a sob\\
I can see the river swallowing her\\
I am not that far, though I can't drive there\\
the bridge has been destroyed\\
the perpatrator has been found, found not guilty\\
afterwards, she is still lost, even more since\\
I crawled back into her life\\
we slept together just before the sun set\\
I told her to leave because she described my fears\\
most accurately, now the phone is dead\\
there is no use picking it up\\
I am only learning to try\\
to get a handle of the will to cling\\

I have lived a long time alone\\
and compressed a few fresh moments of togetherness\\
along the way, a crystallized kaleidoscope built\\
for memories as long as they which means I, last


\section{atfirst}
\subsection{envy}

at the party\\
there weren't that many\\
people; the young man could\\
see what mattered; not himself\\
he could tell you that much\\
looking for softer mattresses\\
until he came about and\\
she had the eyes of his memory\\
the lies of his own imagination\\
bliss looked ever so distant\\

there was a table and six\\
or seven chairs; just enough\\
it wasn't raining yet\\
but you could feel it coming\\
with sparks and ozone holes\\
drifting above; choosing the signs\\
to follow seemed easy at first\\

but then again\\
envy was a twisted word\\
hair was messy and the grapes\\
tasted good enough; his pulse ran\\
deep, beneath randomness and\\
artesian caves where the fish swim\\
\clearpage


\subsection{aftermath}


when they arrived at his parents house\\
the door was locked\\
so he had to force it\\
softly; and yet it cracked\\
it was cold outside afterall\\
he was in some kind of rush\\
there was no going back\\
after she kissed him\\

he couldn't tell who had\\
made the first move\\
thinking comes later\\
when you wish for the woman\\
of your dreams and\\
nightmares lose their meaning\\
the first word he could utter\\
was \textit{fuck}; all the hair was soft\\
even the close shaven one was golden\\
and sweet; she slept with it and her\\
underwear was near enough\\
so as to forget the fault\\

because doors shouldn't\\
crack, they should swivel\\
and turn but he was in a rush\\
to see how far life should go\\
in those moments decisions\\
aren't what they seem\\
they crack\\
ever so gently
\clearpage



\subsection{cars}

the waters are shallow\\
don't you know\\
you can't fly although\\
the feeling only shows when loneliness\\
seems deeper than a  night without.-- \\
the insects stop buzzing our ears; ache\\
the pools are not vast enough to get lost in\\
your eyes, deeper than I could  imagine\\
still call at 3am --- a dead phone\\
all we ever needed was a car ride\\
past midnight; when lights blur\\
and rain  could choose its own direction\\
just another word for speed\\
her quick witted smile could tame\\
the wildest eyebrows\\

her beauty needs  motion\\
like delicate clocks I could see her face\\
only by glimpsing across our\\
rift of emptiness\\
I wish I could promise\\
the waters are as shallow\\
as they sound but here\\
they refract my loneliness\\
in green grey shapes of tomorrow\\

The car is old the streets are filled\\
untill we get to the place\\
where streams lullaby us to sleep\\
and where nothing matters really\\
in the end peace was what\\
we were striving for\\
away from passion and envy\\
and where words only mean\\
what they meant
\clearpage

\section{absence}
\subsection{pills}

Now you're laying asleep, content\\
with tamed eyes, absent from me\\
sheltered from me\\
they caressed your Hair\\
slipped the pill under your tongue\\
and whispered soft ``it's okay's''\\
here the windows are blurry with rain\\
glossing out construction cranes\\
--refracting the dying lights\\

The chairs were almost comfortable\\
and within their mutual angle\\
you only had to roll your eyes to\\
spray a distant stare\\
We used to have warm ashtrays\\
hot coffee,\\
cold feet; torn out socks\\
Scrambled eggs and ``fuck you weddings''\\
they caressed your hair\\
Slipped the pill under your tongue\\
and whispered their soft it's  okay's\\

You  should wake up and forget\\
but you slept remembering\\
they wear white coats\\
and indulgent airs\\
I will wear guilt and satisfation\\
when you woke up and remembered\\
I went for a long walk and you never came?
\clearpage

\subsection{morning}

in the morning they found a naked \\
young man yelling atop its breath\\
``i didnt want to i swear i swear'' \\
what are you rambling about --\\
said the older man\\
``does it matter, i swear I didn't,\\
want to'', then why did you; tym ?\\
precisely what I'm trying to \\
figure out; at last, he cried in the dark\\

can we talk at least, but less\\
well yes but i cant promise\\
I won't yell it into your ear until it bursts,\\
a young man is just trying to release\\
the older waters which are still stuck\\
experience tells me \&\\
one can see through your blinded logical scaffolding's\\
I guess I just wish I knew why you\\
are still looking for meaning\\
where there is clearly none\\
but hear this: \\
at the very least it will be inside \& \\



you look tired of outdoors\\
in the night it was still \\
the same old story untill\\
an even older man asked the even younger man \\
``why are you naked in the streets old sport''\\
I'm just looking for a mirror to spit into\\
and what do I look like says you \\
not a mirror I can tell you that much\\
and thus history repeated itself\\

but wherelse am I supposed to look, ---\\
we used to drive into sunsets holding hands and now\\
the sun rises on me but its lonely\\
I prefered to to shine with her\\
why aren't you with her then\\
but old man why don't you get\\
it is precisely what I'm trying to figure out\\
I still cry to marc ribot's guitar you see?\\
why can't you? you should be able to tell\\
one day youll know young man,
well i know one thing\\
I know itll be too late\\

\clearpage
\subsection{evening}

it is hard to say why\\
evenings hit the hardest\\
tym forgets, despite himself, at what time\\
the same old sun sets.\\
it slips by, eclipsed by the moon's signs\\
He just sits there, waits for a shadow\\
a silhouette of himself which is less shallow\\
muttering to himself; as for a prayer\\
``you were there when it mattered\\
something must have shattered''\\

actions are words sometimes; the\\
walls close in \& what else was tym left\\
with then but words words and words\\
he should heave learned: closed doors don't have to hurt\\
when you fold your clothes; \& the day\\
has been well spent\\

when it mattered I was chasing\\
instead of waiting, imitating --- \\
the tail never caught on to the trick\\
and now tym forgets the names of trees\\
\clearpage

\section{also}
\subsection{here}

here we can see; the winds\\
carry nothing into grey bliss\\
pale blue is not the color\\
we had chosen but it is ours\\
before we can hear our cries\\
the post man delivers\\
the cats get lost in alleyways\\
as soon as doors open\\
they come back to lick\\
their paws\\
gently\\
because whoever was in a rush\\
was gravely mistaken\\

the winds are hollow\\
we had chosen others and;\\
they carry nothing but empty smiles\\
of old varnish, where are the \textcolor{pink}{colors}\\
are they too old to be told?\\
pale blue wasn't supposed to\\
be the one \ldots at least it is cozy up there when\\
we can see the skies drifting\\

after we can see the limits\\
the employees punch in with weary eyes\\
discontent of their own desired cycles\\
and when they close doors\\
they don't double check the locks\\
because who would care\\
if one were to disappear\\
vanishing with hope\\
\clearpage

\subsection{guilt}

as the postman came back\\
guilty of forgetting the sweetest package\\
an old man was looking for photographed\\
operands; right behind closed curtains\\
he should have looked under the couch\\
where our dreams used to live\\
they haven't  died they simply\\
chose new names such as\\
lotion cream and neons; flashing\\
and the sweetest apathy brings it back\\
whatever it was\\

we have to look for them\\
they hide well\\
beneath guilt they haven't died\\
they chose incense and flowers\\
we chose vodka and unskimmed milk\\
as the postman licked his paws\\
I lectured him on hygiene\\
national geographic would\\
have done it better for\\
it is objective\\

the new names sometimes\\
seem rather obtuse or strange\\
do not be alarmed by that fact\\
young man one day yellow will be blue\\
purple will be pink and an old order will be\\
restored; so to speak
\clearpage

\subsection{brunch}

he had a passionate love \\
and hate relationship with\\
some kinds of avocados\\
as If it were hard to\\
disentangle the vegan\\
ethics \& the many fruitful deaths\\
from them? whoever they were\\
brunches reeked of untainted privilege,\\
when you pay for the fact you\\
can eat before you are;\\
being actually fully awoke\\

on a related note he\\
dutifully (or so he thought?) preferred cold\\
left over coffees and desk computations\\
pre-urinal conversations; post coital\\
refreshed purity in all its\\
musky forms shapes and scents\\
where else what else could you find\\
in the internet days\\
such man is but a relay\\
and where else was he supposed to look for\\
the misty rains of a better year\\


\textit{but it has always been that way they yellled} \\
his eyes could say no more than\\
yes but even then: we had hope,\\
in the trees in the birds in the sun glows\\
now dissipated in the midst of blue fluocompact lights\\
how should one choose his own\\
lightbulb to read by\\
lost psalms and poems of soft beautiful agony\\


\clearpage


\section{far}
\subsection{how so}

relativity is a strange word\\
when far feels very much alive\\
some people spend lives measuring\\
osculating; spending thrift change\\
to get neat answers like\\
6 foot three and barry is an asshole\\
but really who knows\\
maybe he was a nice guy in the end\\
we know dwelling on it doesn't do\\

because quite simply\\
being sometimes is not enough\\
I still crave for those answers, \\
I could stop if\\
the cat would stop getting inside\\
but it always finds a crack a crevisse\\
strangers who are without a room have a past\\
and will always curl inwards searching for true memories\\
unfucked with, the presence of the real\\
behind the blossoms of gardens\\
planted for the sake of time\\
well spent\\

now tell me\\
do you like my new haircut\\
I told the barber\\
to remind me of me\\
I think he did a swell job\\
untill someone asked me how was my acting career\\
doing, well screw you and your pictures\\
your  well adjusted\\
routines is what I told the chump\\
now I'm left with bitterness\\
of my own making and two birds\
they won't stop shitting just\\
just besides the cage\\
now can god make a good metaphor of that\\
because I'm tired and it was a nice couch\\
the winds are stronger than I thought
\clearpage


\subsection{enough}

as tym crossed the street\\
he saw two cars of different\\
shades pass by him\\
he waltzed and gave a hard\\
stare at the cat\\
peering over closed curtains\\
he couldn't choose\\
which one \\

so he strolled passed\\
to find some shade in\\
the orchard where knowledge\\
at least is not frowned upon\\
he found a place where windows\\
exist, however inside is still different\\
outside is colder and gray\\
inside is cozy and pale red\\
you might catch a glimpse\\
but for that you need to choose your\\
waking hours\\

the difference is slim\\
it might be a slight wind draught\\
or the echo of a lover with broken arms\\
are they still useful? why yes of course!\\
\clearpage
\subsection{waiting}

pale blue wasn't supposed\\
to be our color; in the great\\
beauty of it all I still catch it\\
the myself looking at ceilings\\
looking for company\\

someday she slept  in like a tempest\\
left no room for apathy\\
which used to be sweet\\
\& so it gave way to restlesness\\
where writing is for publishers\\
and tides only come in\\
when the horoscopes tell them so\\

tym never travelled enough\\
he preferred the confines of his own mind\\
--- peeking for lightness\\
and as was foretold he found\\
choosing your prison\\
is simply a matter of semantics; \\
rethorically speaking
\clearpage

\section{nicotine}
\subsection{the last one}

the last one can be hard to digest\\
you will play with it  and ignore\\
the rest a little, tym but always\\
let time work \& remember why you came here\\
you had \textit{reasons} and\\
\textit{objectives}\\

can you at least\\
hum, tell me what they were\\
because to me it felt quite simply\\
like licking my paws\\
and strolling through a different\\
parallax; for it be to leveled\\

well first of all tym\\
you need to stop\\
hiding behind all those words\\
they will bite --- and hurt you back\\
those games are not meant\\
to be played by the score\\
otherwise you will crack\\
and the cats will come back
\clearpage
\subsection{uncertainty}

but now tell me\\
how long should I wait\\
as long as it takes they say\\
but that just adds to the smell\\
of deja vu, which is good\\
it also hurts though\\

it will hurt as long as\\
you don't understand\\
the point, and keep looking\\
for the lines, the sharp ones\\
the diagonals -- ;\\
they go too deep for your\\
young heart you should, stick to parallel\\
parking and learn it good,\\

hear me out; unlearn the smoke\\
and the release in cycles\\
for tomorrow is just the same\\
what should you claim for it\\
to be different? -- now don't\\
make me laugh, my back still hurts
\clearpage


\subsection{sleep}

tym went to his bed and looked for sleep\\
where there is none\\
as was foretold, but now think\\
why should it be there when you look\\
for the absence --\\
he opened a book; and threw it out\\

then another one\\
and the process went on\\
turning over maybe towards some\\
parallax of lost years\\
which; was fidgeting with his memory\\
when eyelids become the last\\
frontier of beauty,\\
rolling above restfulness\\
and so he remembered tom's advice\\

you need to stop fidgeting tym\\
it won't help no one\\
sit still and un-arch your back\\
focus on some task otherwise you know well;\\
in old age it will come back to haunt you\\
your posture I mean, lying down while the world wakes\\
can be often a cowardly act\\
\clearpage


\section{moving}
\subsection{somewhere}

sieves are the hardest to knit\\
you need patience and wit\\
some of the musics looses magic\\
when frontiers define the tragic\\
blank verse is for cowards\\
free is even worse, so shouted\\
the post modern man\\

intrinsic to the goal are the river's shores\\
you need synthetic clothings\\
canoes and devices, the wind won't push you\\
only if you let it fall,\\
only then will space fill the fields\\
acting on a distance is not how they work\\
they're simply there, osculating the waves\\

when tym reached for another book,\\
he opened it at random, or so he tried\\
signs and patterns were still there\\
for the first line told him of his own mistakes\\
do not try to let it go to waste\\
the land will not let signs unsused\\
in the shadow of the crane\\
at each waking hour we can see each other\\
getting built from small parts, bits at a time\\
some cities are bigger than others\\
getting lost is an art hard to practice\\
you need highways and tall buildings\\
tym preferred the comfort of knowing\\
exactly and precisely the wrong things
\clearpage

\subsection{horizon}

here the winds are clear\\
the flatness conjures something else\\
which cannot be fathomed;\\
the soft ripple of the stems\\
caress the horizons\\

fuzzyness is hard to define\\
yet you can feel it in empty mornings\\
we flash and yearn yet are bored\\
like Henry tym was lost between gripes\\
yet looked onwards towards fields\\
of yellow tranquil hills\\

do not go off chasing it\\
it will only leave you panting\\
tym needs to walk, resilience\\
hard stares and empty air\\
is where you'll find peace\\
was said before sometimes\\
\clearpage

\subsection{distance}

the coffee was cold\\
and so was the trail\\
of some lost details; hidden\\
perhaps, beneath all the rest\\
which was laid bare to see\\

with binoculars for eyes\\
weren't enough; they were hard angles\\
and soft touches to find that night\\
the young man glimpsed at what was left\\
of his well sketched future\\

she was dancing and didn't care\\
he was drinking for the courage\\
it didn't come; why would it\\
all the people were celebrating\\
reasons and meanings, while tym\\
rested his elbows, concentrating\\
\clearpage

\section{choices}
\subsection{beginnings}

do not go off chasing\\
finding is easier when you let it\\
waltz and dance at a distance\\
moreover the touch is softer to those\\
who, unlike tym, can wait to be blessed\\
and are able to see the fuzzy winds \\
piercing through some of the deeper analogies\\

they cannot be predicted\\
and even if they could\\
why would they come\\
behind the bridge next to its shadow\\
where the pebbles are dirty\\
but the waters still flow, underanged\\

you can cast one if you feel like it\\
the faster the better probably ---\\
let them spin, the axis is your choice\\
tym felt a chore out of being amongst\\
so many rocks, where should he sit?

\clearpage

\subsection{textures}

\input{textures}

this day the air is porous\\
and I can feel the sun\\
sliding down across the\\
reaches of your skin\\
I've never known why we were\\
looking across the same\\
pale landscapes; \\
but I couln't reach your hand\\
and chain our memories\\
to anchors of distant bliss\\

the ice cream cone\\
reflected your yesterdays ---;\\
joy, untamed yet in your eyes\\
I let the clouds gently slide\\
caressing what was left of\\
my palms\\

you were there, behind the tree\\
I could not walk in the same tracks\\
so I drifted, downwards to the same\\
old circles of me where sense ends\\
and new beginnings were there to find\\
\clearpage

\subsection{magic}


from the other side of the street\\
where the trees crack at nights\\
is where you'll find it\\
the magic; splitting ever --\\
in corals and roots\\
and wonder why are you still looking so far\\
when what is harboured is also\\
always within reach for the delicate hand\\

you can let it fall\\
or try to grasp at the stems\\
catch you breath however\\
going fast makes no distinction\\
in the great beauty of it all\\
speed is simply one of those details\\

stopping has many synonyms\\
like loving for an instant\\
so tym --- please don't go off running like that\\
it is here; all around you\\
tom why the hell do you think ? \& \\
thus this is precisely why I keep going\\
in circles of restlessness, I would ve thought\\
and educated man such as yourself\\
would comprehend such things\\
\clearpage

\section{night}
\subsection{the street}

sitting on brick made stairs\\
the street was empty apart\\
from a couple parked cars\\
and the ruffle in the leaves\\
while lets not forget the light\\

buzzing from high ways\\
lampposts could hide the sky\\
teeming up with refreshed trees\\
tym wondered where they all went\\

however it didn't matter\\
his location was enough\\
and well found amongst\\
other urbanites looking for\\
some peace, elsewhere; maybe\\
of fresh quiet in the humid air\\
yesterday it was
\clearpage
\subsection{trees}
\input{trees}

they split everso\\
and try to reach, higher\\
than where we led them\\
trees are the balance, arborescence\\
we were looking for before growing up\\
now they simply hang, content of their\\
own rustlin in the wind\\

tym stretched his legs\\
laid back in the chair, admiring\\
there was finally no point in moving\\
the leaves were doing it for him\\
epiphanies are too fast\\
he needs slow pulses of dancing\\

around his mind, a haircut maybe\\
but not today, he prefers the rustle\\
and the breeze that precedes it\\
something one cannot predict\\
\clearpage

\subsection{wind}

it can be hard to adjust\\
to the speed at which it travels\\
choosing an angle to deflect\\
the hard winds of plains and mountains\\
they travel without warning\\

so he sat in diagonals to it\\
\& and he never saw the instinct\\
to move, restlessness is in the small moments\\
where why can he not\\
let it go let it be\\

it needs to be bottled first\\
and filtered, like sparkly springs\\
he flirts with apathy once again\\
only it has no movement\\
its water is murky\\
speed is essential, eventhough\\
we all know it to be relative
\clearpage

\section{after}
\subsection{endings}

when axioms fall,  let them sit tym\\
open them up in new spheres where beginnings\\
and endings stop in the wonder\\
apathy needs room to grow\\
-- \& blossom into new presents\\

spaces are chained to the times\\
where life meant more than the words\\
they tend to get lost in the details\\
into the featherly rustle which can wait\\
it will try to escape\\

the futures of yesterday are long gone\\
and remember them after they pass\\
the links are soft to those who\\
have the touch, delicate and effervescent\\
\clearpage

\subsection{loneliness}

you need to be able to bear the loneliness of the nights\\
to find peace in the winds and waves of your own mind\\
even and maybe especially if it makes your soul shriek\\
it won't crack, in the deep there is no one but yourself\\

landing is easy as long as intoxication doesn't go too far\\
there will be silence in the great apathy of stillness\\
those are lands to be explored, and left, uncharted\\
sometimes I fail and I wish there was another way\\
to drift and let the pieces fall together without intent\\

but the night is everywhere; \& so are you\\
I could never dislodge you from there\\
and never wanted to; I head your voice in\\
the distant echo of lost cars\\
and even more so in the one of those who have finally found their way\\
across the city there are so many of them, they chant your voice,
quietly, the rustle won't stop, why would it?

\clearpage

\subsection{hotels}

air conditionning and clean white tiled showerooms\\
are where tym finds himself, comforted by the white noise\\
of strange places where there is no one to mirror his longings\\
he needs stillness in the cold artificial air\\
the flickerings reach the right frequencies\\
60 hz is the number I think old man\\
ah yes but you need to inhale deeper tym\\

let it reach its zenith before you scale down\\
the mountain of lonely nights, I hope you know\\
by now that going down is harder than climbing up\\
and windows closed will teach you independence\\
of nature and of self, cut yourself from your fins\\
and reach for more more and more until less is undefined\\


I thought you were a sophisticated fellow\\
who enjoys poems, walks in the woods and smokez the pipes\\
now stop playing with cigarettes, you'll burn your fingers\\
``no this is not how it \textit{went}'', I can almost guarantee\\
\clearpage

\section{bigger}
\subsection{lies}

I told them the greatest lie\\
that we might as well be a little too crazy\\
since the sun, and the moon, all will soon die\\
in the books they told me it is so\\
how I chase and yearn for more\\

the characters have poise meaning and directions\\
in this stage with no director tym\\
is still looking for more pages\\
arcs to follow and loves to be betrayed\\
meetings of young fellow of hearts and minds\\
on dinner tables under scarce yellow light bulb\\
at night, of course ---

where smoke flows slowly with no urgency\\
and scraps of paper are spreaded, unevenly\\
poetry, waiting to be written, where friends\\
assemble and the chitchatter reverberates\\
creativity and such bore me now\\
an outside is needed, to reveal what lies\\
in the pages yet to be written\\

\clearpage

\subsection{echoes}

now i live in conditionned air territory\\
it used to be that distant echoes of craving\\
could nourrish loneliness with some depth of feeling\\
I had to put on my blue sweater \\
and turn the machine on\\

it rumbles smoothly, trying to concoct a lullaby\\
all I have are my memories of her's\\
the disjuncted ex's, whom i mesh in a fabric to sleep with\\
lay quietly under them, while the ill will whispers\\
tonight reality read from books sounds more concrete\\
more anchored, as if life prefers having some frame of reference\\
to circumscribe our confused airs of loneliness\\

If only I learned of the difference between inside \& outside\\
maybe, then, I could really lie next to you\\
always I thought I needed but so little\\
and here I am, wishing your presence, knowing I need it\\
yet should not, there are other ways tym they said\\
they are hard to find, I'll keep looking\\
\clearpage
\subsection{lake}

where the lake ends and the creek begins\\
the silence was punctured by acoustic guitars\\
and distant laughter, applying new layers to\\
the sound of water claping on the riverbank\\
speeches are ignored, we preferred the crackling of the fire\\

best not meddle with inner peace maybe finally\\
reached, here, no need to tell the hard beautiful truths\\
they gleam, spark and dance around the ambers\\
and the fat drips from the chicken to the fire\\
through the blessed grill\\

meals are shared instinctively\\
the nearest guitar plays blues which is alright\\
until a pop tune can be recognized whence eyebrows are raised\\
there is reefer, maybe too much of it, who can tell --- \\
in the nightsky; what truths seem concealed from sane eyes\\
we are lacking bourbon and
here they simply ripple and glide slowly\\
over the canvas of our half shared tents\\

\clearpage

\section{certainties}
\subsection{loveable}

tym thanked her for finally\\
giving him a reason --- in the center --- amongst the madness\\
beyond this everthing rhymed of plunder, pillage and arson\\
imagination curtailed and instants losing their eternity\\
the big city is far but we have fire and thats probably enough for now\\
I don't have to keep waiting for you but I always will, somehow\\

I'll do it for the plot, for the coherence of it\\
not for love's apathy or closure, who needs any of that\\
the boats are just a shade from this distance\\
the dock is where I used to remember, now I come to forget\\


\clearpage

\subsection{newyork}

Hello New York, I don't know if you'll\\
be reading this but I don't know how to wait\\
I feel certain a new me is growing inside the old one\\
and I'm not sure I have the bones to carry it\\
I visited you once, before tym was even born\\
walked the streets looking for cafes to read in\\

where are you new york, my bones are now\\
older than my skin, i know it\\
pillows stay attached to dreams of a long time ago\\
when we both rested to the same music\\
it still rings in my ear, the same chord\\
and the saint lawrence, flowing beneath the long\\
road downhill towards the ferry\\

tym quit playing around and let that cat go\\
mind its own business, these are serious matters\\
music and love, lost in unsettled memories\\
prisoners to unkept adjectives\\
im still waiting new york, i have nowhere else to be\\
\clearpage

\subsection{certainty}

Laughter was supposed to make you feel better,\\
tym had a happy one then a sad one, took one more sip &\\
jolly were the times considering he had to observe\\
whether his defitinition of love fit the context\\
certainty can be hard to come by,\\
we need to reflect on certain things\\
the plate was empty and one gulp was left in his glass\\

he took a sip, choked on it, the healthy reflex\\
of the diafragm somehow reassuring in the relative world\\
of stars and motions; fixed points being the art of nothingness\\
time is a lie, yelled tom interrupting this reverie \&\\
whoever disagrees can bite it\\

maybe but it's a first rate lie\\
can't come up with anything better I can tell you\\
the new cults emerge longing for a new millenium which\\
didn't come, the XXth just emerged with a fresh new coat of paint\\
the apocalypse won't come even if the waters heat up\\
we'll still have hollow rivers to go cry by\\
drowning the sound of the memories' melodies\\

\section{again}
\subsection{waves}
and here it goes again, for tym\\
the hidden meanings and aprehensions\\
the soul curlin inwards for a jest\\
a world completely and uniquely determined\\
yet metaphorical

\subsection{happy}
Everyone is alone but tym\\
tumbling along for an empty trick\\
a quick fix for the nightmares will do\\
rest assured, he knows where to go\\
y'all ought to worry about your own fears\\
such as poverty and poorly attempted exorcisms\\

One doesn't have to know to see\\
and he sees alright, where the madness lies\\
dogs wag their tail walkers--- pick up the mess\\
thrice a day at least, what matters is in where\\
you find your final rest, even if you wake up afterwards\\


\subsection{sounds}
there was more to what he heard\\
than music, he strolled past idioms\\
ways of life and loves of old\\
couldn't fathom picking a lane\\
so swerved in and out of life\\
looking for what cannot be seen\\
only contemplated, rhythm was all\\
he could not dance to it, nor whistle\\


he chose the ripe fruit\\
the one that would explode in his mouth\\
ashtrays littered the table and coffee stains\\
we yet to be polished out, what use is there\\
in setting a bed right for one\\

loneliness prefers the couch\\
it has a side to lean onto\\
falling off is easier there are arms to grip\\
and twisting and tumbling has more charm to it

\section{wishes}

\subsection{patterns}
there are no strangers in psychosis\\
only patterns and auguries of strange premonitions\\
even tears have meaning, beyond the scope of imagination\\
it is the opposite of apathy, where ectasy brings pannic\\

there are no strangers when you really think about it\\
mystic connections aren't meant to be known\\
otherwise what's the point in higher meanings\\
let the animals wander aimlessly, you are just the same\\

here I am all alone wondering how much\\
emptiness i can squeeze in this small box\\
life has been emptied of directions\\
the cat crosses the word safely and we won't go look for it\\
here I am wishing for more strangers, more nerve to agitate this world\\
the words are not enough as they have been\\


\subsection{music}

The music of my life needs a good bass line\\
for the time being it's all tired pentatonic guitar riffs\\
trying to escape cliches tym finds himself in a ditch\\
where snow creaks with a million years of tears\\
and the sounds echo with nowhere to go\\
go find it, the melody, for we all need a theme\\

some inner depth to draw strenght from\\
the rebirth of romanticism was not without difficulties\\
we were still blinded by enlightnment tendencies\\
we were still looking for eternal truths\\
until we realized the snow creaks under our shoes in a nice way\\
and that was that\\


tym thinks he lacks inner ressources; trying to get emotional\\
in front of landscapes, it was long walk was it worth it?\\
another silly question I resent you for asking it\\
coffee stains and 3 months relationships are the stuff of my life\\
I figured HE would know how to make something beautiful out of it\\
but Tym is too high to write again, so here I am
