the streets were yellow empty\\
and the mists welcoming\\
so tym went for a stroll\\
amongst losers and what nots\\
he could find the readers of truth\\

walking took to long\\
so he hastened the pace\\
some buildings still echoed\\
hence he felt like nemo\\
still and ever for looking\\
the narrative where is\\
