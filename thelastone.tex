the last one can be hard to digest\\
you will play with it  and ignore\\
the rest a little, tym but always\\
let time work \& remember why you came here\\
you had \textit{reasons} and\\
\textit{objectives}\\

can you at least\\
hum, tell me what they were\\
because to me it felt quite simply\\
like licking my paws\\
and strolling through a different\\
parallax; for it be to leveled\\

well first of all tym\\
you need to stop\\
hiding behind all those words\\
they will bite --- and hurt you back\\
those games are not meant\\
to be played by the score\\
otherwise you will crack\\
and the cats will come back
