sieves are the hardest to knit\\
you need patience and wit\\
some of the musics looses magic\\
when frontiers define the tragic\\
blank verse is for cowards\\
free is even worse, so shouted\\
the post modern man\\

intrinsic to the goal are the river's shores\\
you need synthetic clothings\\
canoes and devices, the wind won't push you\\
only if you let it fall,\\
only then will space fill the fields\\
acting on a distance is not how they work\\
they're simply there, osculating the waves\\

when tym reached for another book,\\
he opened it at random, or so he tried\\
signs and patterns were still there\\
for the first line told him of his own mistakes\\
do not try to let it go to waste\\
the land will not let signs unsused\\
in the shadow of the crane\\
at each waking hour we can see each other\\
getting built from small parts, bits at a time\\
some cities are bigger than others\\
getting lost is an art hard to practice\\
you need highways and tall buildings\\
tym preferred the comfort of knowing\\
exactly and precisely the wrong things
