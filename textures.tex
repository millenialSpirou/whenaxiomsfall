this day the air is porous\\
and I can feel the sun\\
sliding down across the\\
reaches of your skin\\
I've never known why we were\\
looking across the same\\
pale landscapes\\

the ice cream cone\\
reflected your yesterdays ---;\\
joy, untamed yet in your eyes\\
I let the clouds gently slide\\
caressing what was left of\\
my palms\\

you there, behind the tree\\
I could not walk in the same circle\\
so I drifted, downwards to the same\\
old circles of me where sense ends\\
and new beginnings were there to find\\
