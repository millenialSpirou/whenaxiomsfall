this day the air is porous\\
and I can feel the sun\\
sliding down across the\\
reaches of your skin\\
I've never known why we were\\
looking across the same\\
pale landscapes; \\
but I couln't reach your hand\\
and chain our memories\\
to anchors of distant bliss\\

the ice cream cone\\
reflected your yesterdays ---;\\
joy, untamed yet in your eyes\\
I let the clouds gently slide\\
caressing what was left of\\
my palms\\

you were there, behind the tree\\
I could not walk in the same tracks\\
so I drifted, downwards to the same\\
old circles of me where sense ends\\
and new beginnings were there to find\\
