when axioms fall,  let them sit tym\\
open them up in new spheres where beginnings\\
and endings stop in the wonder\\
apathy needs room to grow\\
-- \& blossom into new presents\\

spaces are chained to the times\\
where life meant more than the words\\
they tend to get lost in the details\\
into the featherly rustle which can wait\\
it will try to escape\\

the futures of yesterday are long gone\\
and remember them after they pass\\
the links are soft to those who\\
have the touch, delicate and effervescent\\
