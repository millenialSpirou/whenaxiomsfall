<h1 id="atfirst">atfirst</h1>
<h2 id="envy">envy</h2>
<p>at the party<br />
there weren’t that many<br />
people; the young man could<br />
see what mattered; not himself<br />
he could tell you that much<br />
looking for softer mattresses<br />
until he came about and<br />
she had the eyes of his memory<br />
the lies of his own imagination<br />
bliss looked ever so distant<br />
there was a table and six<br />
or seven chairs; just enough<br />
it wasn’t raining yet<br />
but you could feel it coming<br />
with sparks and ozone holes<br />
drifting above; choosing the signs<br />
to follow seemed easy at first<br />
but then again<br />
envy was a twisted word<br />
hair was messy and the grapes<br />
tasted good enough; his pulse ran<br />
deep, beneath randomness and<br />
artesian caves where the fish swim<br />
</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">aftermath</h2>
<p>when they arrived at his parents house<br />
the door was locked<br />
so he had to force it<br />
ever so gently; and yet it cracked<br />
it was cold outside afterall<br />
there was no going back<br />
after she kissed him<br />
he couldn’t tell who had<br />
made the first move<br />
thinking comes later<br />
when you wish for the woman<br />
of your dreams and<br />
nightmares lose their meaning<br />
the first word he could utter<br />
was <em>fuck</em>; all the hair was soft<br />
even the close shaven one was golden<br />
and sweet; she slept with it and her<br />
underwear was near enough<br />
so as to forget the fault<br />
because doors shouldn’t<br />
crack, they should swivel<br />
and turn but he was in a rush<br />
to see how far life should go<br />
in those moments decisions<br />
aren’t what they seem<br />
they crack<br />
ever so gently</p>
<h2 id="cars">cars</h2>
<p>the waters are shallow<br />
don’t you know<br />
you can’t fly although<br />
the feeling only shows when loneliness<br />
seems deeper than a night without.–<br />
the insects stop buzzing our ears; ache<br />
the pools are not vast enough to get lost in<br />
your eyes, deeper than I could imagine<br />
still call at 3am — a dead phone<br />
all we ever needed was a car ride<br />
past midnight; when lights blur<br />
and rain could choose its own direction<br />
just another word for speed<br />
her quick witted smile could tame<br />
the wildest eyebrows<br />
her beauty needs motion<br />
like delicate clocks I could see her face<br />
only by glimpsing across our<br />
rift of emptiness<br />
I wish I could promise<br />
the waters are as shallow<br />
as they sound but here<br />
they refract my loneliness<br />
in green grey shapes of tomorrow<br />
The car is old the streets are filled<br />
untill we get to the place<br />
where streams lullaby us to sleep<br />
and where nothing matters really<br />
in the end peace was what<br />
we were striving for<br />
away from passion and envy<br />
and where words only mean<br />
what they meant</p>
<h1 id="absence">absence</h1>
<h2 id="pills">pills</h2>
<p>Now you’re laying asleep, content<br />
with tamed eyes, absent from me<br />
sheltered from me<br />
they caressed your Hair<br />
slipped the pill under your tongue<br />
and whispered soft “it’s okay’s”<br />
here the windows are blurry with rain<br />
glossing out construction cranes<br />
–refracting the dying lights<br />
The chairs were almost comfortable<br />
and within their mutual angle<br />
you only had to roll your eyes to<br />
spray a distant stare<br />
We used to have warm ashtrays<br />
hot coffee,<br />
cold feet; torn out socks<br />
Scrambled eggs and “fuck you weddings”<br />
they caressed your hair<br />
Slipped the pill under your tongue<br />
and whispered their soft it’s okay’s<br />
You should wake up and forget<br />
but you slept remembering<br />
they wear white coats<br />
and indulgent airs<br />
I will wear guilt and satisfation<br />
when you woke up and remembered<br />
I went for a long walk and you never came?</p>
<h2 id="morning">morning</h2>
<p>in the morning they found a naked<br />
young man yelling atop its breath<br />
“i didnt want to i swear i swear”<br />
what are you rambling about –<br />
said the older man<br />
“does it matter, i swear I didn’t,<br />
want to”, then why did you; tym ?<br />
precisely what I’m trying to<br />
figure out; at last, he cried in the dark<br />
can we talk at least, but less<br />
well yes but i cant promise<br />
I won’t yell it into your ear until it bursts,<br />
a young man is just trying to release<br />
the older waters which are still stuck<br />
experience tells me &amp;<br />
one can see through your blinded logical scaffolding’s<br />
I guess I just wish I knew why you<br />
are still looking for meaning<br />
where there is clearly none<br />
but hear this:<br />
at the very least it will be inside &amp;<br />
you look tired of outdoors<br />
in the night it was still<br />
the same old story untill<br />
an even older man asked the even younger man<br />
“why are you naked in the streets old sport”<br />
I’m just looking for a mirror to spit into<br />
and what do I look like says you<br />
not a mirror I can tell you that much<br />
and thus history repeated itself<br />
but wherelse am I supposed to look, —<br />
we used to drive into sunsets holding hands and now<br />
the sun rises on me but its lonely<br />
I prefered to to shine with her<br />
why aren’t you with her then<br />
but old man why don’t you get<br />
it is precisely what I’m trying to figure out<br />
I still cry to marc ribot’s guitar you see?<br />
why can’t you? you should be able to tell<br />
one day youll know young man, well i know one thing<br />
I know itll be too late<br />
</p>
<h2 id="evening">evening</h2>
<p>evenings hit the hardest<br />
when tym forgets at what time<br />
the same old sun sets.<br />
it slips by, eclipsed by the moon’s signs<br />
He just waits for a shadow<br />
a silhouette of himself which is less shallow<br />
you were there when it mattered<br />
something must have shattered<br />
actions are words when the<br />
walls close in what else was tym left with then words words and words<br />
hinges don’t have to hurt when<br />
you fold your clothes; &amp; the day<br />
was well spent<br />
when it mattered I was chasing<br />
instead of waiting, imitating —<br />
the tail never caught on to the trick<br />
and now tym forgets the names of trees<br />
</p>
<h1 id="also">also</h1>
<h2 id="here">here</h2>
<p>here we can see; the winds<br />
carry nothing into grey bliss<br />
pale blue is not the color<br />
we had chosen but it is ours<br />
before we can hear our cries<br />
the post man delivers<br />
the cats get lost in alleyways<br />
as soon as doors open<br />
they come back to lick<br />
their paws<br />
gently<br />
because whoever was in a rush<br />
was gravely mistaken<br />
the winds are hollow<br />
we had chosen others and;<br />
they carry nothing but empty smiles<br />
of old varnish, where are the<br />
are they too old to be told?<br />
pale blue wasn’t supposed to<br />
be the one... at least it is cozy up there when<br />
we can see the skies drifting<br />
after we can see the limits<br />
the employees punch in with weary eyes<br />
discontent of their own desired cycles<br />
and when they close doors<br />
they don’t double check the locks<br />
because who would care<br />
if one were to disappear<br />
vanishing with hope<br />
</p>
<h2 id="guilt">guilt</h2>
<p>as the postman came back<br />
guilty of forgetting the sweetest package<br />
an old man was looking for photographed<br />
operands; right behind closed curtains<br />
he should have looked under the couch<br />
where our dreams used to live<br />
they haven’t died they simply<br />
chose new names such as<br />
lotion cream and neons; flashing<br />
and the sweetest apathy brings it back<br />
whatever it was<br />
we have to look for them<br />
they hide well<br />
beneath guilt they haven’t died<br />
they chose incense and flowers<br />
we chose vodka and unskimmed milk<br />
as the postman licked his paws<br />
I lectured him on hygiene<br />
national geographic would<br />
have done it better for<br />
it is objective<br />
the new names sometimes<br />
seem rather obtuse or strange<br />
do not be alarmed by that fact<br />
young man one day yellow will be blue<br />
purple will be pink and an old order will be<br />
restored; so to speak</p>
<h2 id="brunch">brunch</h2>
<p>he had a passionate love<br />
and hate relationship with<br />
some kinds of avocados<br />
as If it were hard to<br />
disentangle the vegan<br />
ethics &amp; the many fruitful deaths<br />
from them? whoever they were<br />
brunches reeked of untainted privilege,<br />
when you pay for the fact you<br />
can eat before you are;<br />
being actually fully awoke<br />
on a related note he<br />
dutifully (or so he thought?) preferred cold<br />
left over coffees and desk computations<br />
pre-urinal conversations; post coital<br />
refreshed purity in all its<br />
musky forms shapes and scents<br />
where else what else could you find<br />
in the internet days<br />
such man is but a relay<br />
and where else was he supposed to look for<br />
the misty rains of a better year<br />
<em>but it has always been that way they yellled</em><br />
his eyes could say no more than<br />
yes but even then : we had hope,<br />
in the trees in the birds in the sun glows<br />
now dissipated in the midst of blue fluocompact lights<br />
how should one choose his own<br />
lightbulb<br />
</p>
<h1 id="far">far</h1>
<h2 id="how-so">how so</h2>
<p>relativity is a strange word<br />
when far feels very much alive<br />
some people spend lives measuring<br />
osculating; spending thrift change<br />
to get neat answers like<br />
6 foot three and barry is an asshole<br />
but really who knows<br />
maybe he was a nice guy in the end<br />
we know dwelling on it doesn’t do<br />
because quite simply<br />
being sometimes is not enough<br />
I still crave for those answers,<br />
I could stop if<br />
the cat would stop getting inside<br />
but it always finds a crack a crevisse<br />
strangers who are without a room have a past<br />
and will always curl inwards searching for true memories<br />
unfucked with, the presence of the real<br />
behind the blossoms of gardens<br />
planted for the sake of time<br />
well spent<br />
now tell me<br />
do you like my new haircut<br />
I told the barber<br />
to remind me of me<br />
I think he did a swell job<br />
untill someone asked me how was my acting career<br />
doing, well screw you and your pictures<br />
your well adjusted<br />
routines is what I told the chump<br />
now I’m left with bitterness<br />
of my own making and two birdsthey won’t stop shitting just<br />
just besides the cage<br />
now can god make a good metaphor of that<br />
because I’m tired and it was a nice couch<br />
the winds are stronger than I thought</p>
<h2 id="enough">enough</h2>
<p>as tym crossed the street<br />
he saw two cars of different<br />
shades pass by him<br />
he waltzed and gave a hard<br />
stare at the cat<br />
peering over closed curtains<br />
he couldn’t choose<br />
which one<br />
so he strolled passed<br />
to find some shade in<br />
the orchard where knowledge<br />
at least is not frowned upon<br />
he found a place where windows<br />
exist, however inside is still different<br />
outside is colder and gray<br />
inside is cozy and pale red<br />
you might catch a glimpse<br />
but for that you need to choose your<br />
waking hours<br />
the difference is slim<br />
it might be a slight wind draught<br />
or the echo of a lover with broken arms<br />
are they still useful? why yes of course!<br />
</p>
<h2 id="waiting">waiting</h2>
<p>pale blue wasn’t supposed<br />
to be our color; in the great<br />
beauty of it all I still catch it<br />
the myself looking at ceilings<br />
looking for company<br />
someday she slept in like a tempest<br />
left no room for apathy<br />
which used to be sweet<br />
&amp; so it gave way to restlesness<br />
where writing is for publishers<br />
and tides only come in<br />
when the horoscopes tell them so<br />
tym never travelled enough<br />
he preferred the confines of his own mind<br />
— peeking for lightness<br />
and as was foretold he found<br />
choosing your prison<br />
is simply a matter of semantics;<br />
rethorically speaking</p>
<h1 id="nicotine">nicotine</h1>
<h2 id="the-last-one">the last one</h2>
<p>the last one can be hard to digest<br />
you will play with it and ignore<br />
the rest a little, tym but always<br />
let time work &amp; remember why you came here<br />
you had <em>reasons</em> and<br />
<em>objectives</em><br />
can you at least<br />
hum, tell me what they were<br />
because to me it felt quite simply<br />
like licking my paws<br />
and strolling through a different<br />
parallax; for it be to leveled<br />
well first of all tym<br />
you need to stop<br />
hiding behind all those words<br />
they will bite — and hurt you back<br />
those games are not meant<br />
to be played by the score<br />
otherwise you will crack<br />
and the cats will come back</p>
<h2 id="uncertainty">uncertainty</h2>
<p>but now tell me<br />
how long should I wait<br />
as long as it takes they say<br />
but that just adds to the smell<br />
of deja vu, which is good<br />
it also hurts though<br />
it will hurt as long as<br />
you don’t understand<br />
the point, and keep looking<br />
for the lines, the sharp ones<br />
the diagonals – ;<br />
they go too deep for your<br />
young heart you should, stick to parallel<br />
parking and learn it good,<br />
hear me out; unlearn the smoke<br />
and the release in cycles<br />
for tomorrow is just the same<br />
what should you claim for it<br />
to be different? – now don’t<br />
make me laugh, my back still hurts</p>
<h2 id="sleep">sleep</h2>
<p>tym went to his bed and looked for sleep<br />
where there is none<br />
as was foretold, but now think<br />
why should it be there when you look<br />
for the absence –<br />
he opened a book; and threw it out<br />
then another one<br />
and the process went on<br />
turning over maybe towards some<br />
parallax of lost years<br />
which; was fidgeting with his memory<br />
when eyelids become the last<br />
frontier of beauty,<br />
rolling above restfulness<br />
and so he remembered tom’s advice<br />
you need to stop fidgeting tym<br />
it won’t help no one<br />
sit still and un-arch your back<br />
focus on some task otherwise you know well;<br />
in old age it will come back to haunt you<br />
your posture I mean, lying down while the world wakes<br />
can be often a cowardly act<br />
</p>
<h1 id="moving">moving</h1>
<h2 id="somewhere">somewhere</h2>
<p>sieves are the hardest to knit<br />
you need patience and wit<br />
some of the musics looses magic<br />
when frontiers define the tragic<br />
blank verse is for cowards<br />
free is even worse, so shouted<br />
the post modern man<br />
intrinsic to the goal are the river’s shores<br />
you need synthetic clothings<br />
canoes and devices, the wind won’t push you<br />
only if you let it fall,<br />
only then will space fill the fields<br />
acting on a distance is not how they work<br />
they’re simply there, osculating the waves<br />
when tym reached for another book,<br />
he opened it at random, or so he tried<br />
signs and patterns were still there<br />
for the first line told him of his own mistakes<br />
do not try to let it go to waste<br />
the land will not let signs unsused<br />
in the shadow of the crane<br />
at each waking hour we can see each other<br />
getting built from small parts, bits at a time<br />
some cities are bigger than others<br />
getting lost is an art hard to practice<br />
you need highways and tall buildings<br />
tym preferred the comfort of knowing<br />
exactly and precisely the wrong things</p>
<h2 id="horizon">horizon</h2>
<p>here the winds are clear<br />
the flatness conjures something else<br />
which cannot be fathomed;<br />
the soft ripple of the stems<br />
caress the horizons<br />
fuzzyness is hard to define<br />
yet you can feel it in empty mornings<br />
we flash and yearn yet are bored<br />
like Henry tym was lost between gripes<br />
yet looked onwards towards fields<br />
of yellow tranquil hills<br />
do not go off chasing it<br />
it will only leave you panting<br />
tym needs to walk, resilience<br />
hard stares and empty air<br />
is where you’ll find peace<br />
was said before sometimes<br />
</p>
<h2 id="distance">distance</h2>
<p>the coffee was cold<br />
and so was the trail<br />
of some lost details; hidden<br />
perhaps, beneath all the rest<br />
which was laid bare to see<br />
with binoculars for eyes<br />
weren’t enough; they were hard angles<br />
and soft touches to find that night<br />
the young man glimpsed at what was left<br />
of his well sketched future<br />
she was dancing and didn’t care<br />
he was drinking for the courage<br />
it didn’t come; why would it<br />
all the people were celebrating<br />
reasons and meanings, while tym<br />
rested his elbows, concentrating<br />
</p>
<h1 id="choices">choices</h1>
<h2 id="beginnings">beginnings</h2>
<p>do not go off chasing<br />
finding is easier when you let it<br />
waltz and dance at a distance<br />
moreover the touch is softer to those<br />
who, unlike tym, can wait to be blessed<br />
and are able to see the fuzzy winds<br />
piercing through some of the deeper analogies<br />
they cannot be predicted<br />
and even if they could<br />
why would they come<br />
behind the bridge next to its shadow<br />
where the pebbles are dirty<br />
but the waters still flow, underanged<br />
you can cast one if you feel like it<br />
the faster the better probably —<br />
let them spin, the axis is your choice<br />
tym felt a chore out of being amongst<br />
so many rocks, where should he sit?</p>
<h2 id="textures">textures</h2>
<p>this day the air is porous<br />
and I can feel the sun<br />
sliding down across the<br />
reaches of your skin<br />
I’ve never known why we were<br />
looking across the same<br />
pale landscapes;<br />
but I couln’t reach your hand<br />
and chain our memories<br />
to anchors of distant bliss<br />
the ice cream cone<br />
reflected your yesterdays —;<br />
joy, untamed yet in your eyes<br />
I let the clouds gently slide<br />
caressing what was left of<br />
my palms<br />
you were there, behind the tree<br />
I could not walk in the same tracks<br />
so I drifted, downwards to the same<br />
old circles of me where sense ends<br />
and new beginnings were there to find<br />
</p>
<h2 id="magic">magic</h2>
<p>from the other side of the street<br />
where the trees crack at nights<br />
is where you’ll find it<br />
the magic; splitting ever –<br />
in corals and roots<br />
and wonder why are you still looking so far<br />
when what is harboured is also<br />
always within reach for the delicate hand<br />
you can let it fall<br />
or try to grasp at the stems<br />
catch you breath however<br />
going fast makes no distinction<br />
in the great beauty of it all<br />
speed is simply one of those details<br />
stopping has many synonyms<br />
like loving for an instant<br />
so tym — please don’t go off running like that<br />
it is here; all around you<br />
tom why the hell do you think ? &amp;<br />
thus this is precisely why I keep going<br />
in circles of restlessness, I would ve thought<br />
and educated man such as yourself<br />
would comprehend such things<br />
</p>
<h1 id="night">night</h1>
<h2 id="the-street">the street</h2>
<p>sitting on brick made stairs<br />
the street was empty apart<br />
from a couple parked cars<br />
and the ruffle in the leaves<br />
while lets not forget the light<br />
buzzing from high ways<br />
lampposts could hide the sky<br />
teeming up with refreshed trees<br />
tym wondered where they all went<br />
however it didn’t matter<br />
his location was enough<br />
and well found amongst<br />
other urbanites looking for<br />
some peace, elsewhere; maybe<br />
of fresh quiet in the humid air<br />
yesterday it was</p>
<h2 id="trees">trees</h2>
<p>they split everso<br />
and try to reach, higher<br />
than where we led them<br />
trees are the balance, arborescence<br />
we were looking for before growing up<br />
now they simply hang, content of their<br />
own rustlin in the wind<br />
tym stretched his legs<br />
laid back in the chair, admiring<br />
there was finally no point in moving<br />
the leaves were doing it for him<br />
epiphanies are too fast<br />
he needs slow pulses of dancing<br />
around his mind, a haircut maybe<br />
but not today, he prefers the rustle<br />
and the breeze that precedes it<br />
something one cannot predict<br />
</p>
<h2 id="wind">wind</h2>
<p>it can be hard to adjust<br />
to the speed at which it travels<br />
choosing an angle to deflect<br />
the hard winds of plains and mountains<br />
they travel without warning<br />
so he sat in diagonals to it<br />
&amp; and he never saw the instinct<br />
to move, restlessness is in the small moments<br />
where why can he not<br />
let it go let it be<br />
it needs to be bottled first<br />
and filtered, like sparkly springs<br />
he flirts with apathy once again<br />
only it has no movement<br />
its water is murky<br />
speed is essential, eventhough<br />
we all know it to be relative</p>
<h1 id="after">after</h1>
<h2 id="endings">endings</h2>
<p>when axioms fall, let them sit tym<br />
open them up in new spheres where beginnings<br />
and endings stop in the wonder<br />
apathy needs room to grow<br />
– &amp; blossom into new presents<br />
spaces are chained to the times<br />
where life meant more than the words<br />
they tend to get lost in the details<br />
into the featherly rustle which can wait<br />
it will try to escape<br />
the futures of yesterday are long gone<br />
and remember them after they pass<br />
the links are soft to those who<br />
have the touch, delicate and effervescent<br />
</p>
<h2 id="loneliness">loneliness</h2>
<p>you need to be able to bear the loneliness of the nights<br />
to find peace in the winds and waves of your own mind<br />
even and maybe especially if it makes your soul shriek<br />
it won’t crack, in the deep there is no one but yourself<br />
landing is easy as long as intoxication doesn’t go too far<br />
there will be silence in the great apathy of stillness<br />
those are lands to be explored, and left, uncharted<br />
sometimes I fail and I wish there was another way<br />
to drift and let the pieces fall together without intent<br />
but the night is everywhere; &amp; so are you<br />
I could never dislodge you from there<br />
and never wanted to; I head your voice in<br />
the distant echo of lost cars<br />
and even more so in the one of those who have finally found their way<br />
across the city there are so many of them, they chant your voice, quietly, the rustle won’t stop, why would it?</p>
<h2 id="hotels">hotels</h2>
<p>air conditionning and clean white tiled showerooms<br />
are where tym finds himself, comforted by the white noise<br />
of strange places where there is no one to mirror his longings<br />
he needs stillness in the cold artificial air<br />
the flickerings reach the right frequencies<br />
60 hz is the number I think old man<br />
ah yes but you need to inhale deeper tym<br />
let it reach its zenith before you scale down<br />
the mountain of lonely nights, I hope you know<br />
by now that going down is harder than climbing up<br />
and windows closed will teach you independence<br />
of nature and of self, cut yourself from your fins<br />
and reach for more more and more until less is undefined<br />
I thought you were a sophisticated fellow<br />
who enjoys poems, walks in the woods and smokez the pipes<br />
now stop playing with cigarettes, you’ll burn your fingers<br />
“no this is not how it <em>went</em>”, I can almost guarantee<br />
</p>
<h1 id="bigger">bigger</h1>
<h2 id="lies">lies</h2>
<p>I told them the greatest lie<br />
that we might as well be a little too crazy<br />
since the sun, and the moon, all will soon die<br />
in the books they told me it is so<br />
how I chase and yearn for more<br />
the characters have poise meaning and directions<br />
in this stage with no director tym<br />
is still looking for more pages<br />
arcs to follow and loves to be betrayed<br />
meetings of young fellow of hearts and minds<br />
on dinner tables under scarce yellow light bulb<br />
at night, of course —</p>
<p>where smoke flows slowly with no urgency<br />
and scraps of paper are spreaded, unevenly<br />
poetry, waiting to be written, where friends<br />
assemble and the chitchatter reverberates<br />
creativity and such bore me now<br />
an outside is needed, to reveal what lies<br />
in the pages yet to be written<br />
</p>
<h2 id="echoes">echoes</h2>
<p>now i live in conditionned air territory<br />
it used to be that distant echoes of craving<br />
could nourrish loneliness with some depth of feeling<br />
I had to put on my blue sweater<br />
and turn the machine on<br />
it rumbles smoothly, trying to concoct a lullaby<br />
all I have are my memories of her’s<br />
the disjuncted ex’s, whom i mesh in a fabric to sleep with<br />
lay quietly under them, while the ill will whispers<br />
tonight reality read from books sounds more concrete<br />
more anchored, as if life prefers having some frame of reference<br />
to circumscribe our confused airs of loneliness<br />
If only I learned of the difference between inside &amp; outside<br />
maybe, then, I could really lie next to you<br />
always I thought I needed but so little<br />
and here I am, wishing your presence, knowing I need it<br />
yet should not, there are other ways tym they said<br />
they are hard to find, I’ll keep looking<br />

<h2 id="lake">lake</h2>
<p>where the lake ends and the creek begins<br />
the silence was punctured by acoustic guitars<br />
and distant laughter, applying new layers to<br />
the sound of water claping on the riverbank<br />
speeches are ignored, we preferred the crackling of the fire<br />
best not meddle with inner peace maybe finally<br />
reached, here, no need to tell the hard beautiful truths<br />
they gleam, spark and dance around the ambers<br />
and the fat drips from the chicken to the fire<br />
through the blessed grill<br />
meals are shared instinctively<br />
the nearest guitar plays blues which is alright<br />
until a pop tune can be recognized whence eyebrows are raised<br />
there is reefer, maybe too much of it, who can tell —<br />
in the nightsky; what truths seem concealed from sane eyes<br />
we are lacking bourbon and here they simply ripple and glide slowly<br />
over the canvas of our half shared tents<br />

<p>tym thanked her for finally<br />
giving him a reason , in the center ,amongst the madness<br />
beyond this everthing rhymed of plunder<br />
imagination curtailed and sweet instants losing their immanence<br />

<h2 id="newyork">newyork</h2>
<p>Hello New York, I don’t know if you’ll<br />
be reading this but I don’t know how to wait<br />
I feel certain a new me is growing inside the old one<br />
and I’m not sure I have the bones to carry it<br />
I visited you once, before tym was even born<br />
walked the streets looking for cafes to read in<br />
where are you new york, my bones are now<br />
older than my skin, i know it<br />
pillows stay attached to dreams of a long time ago<br />
when we both rested to the same music<br />
it still rings in my ear, the same chord<br />
and the saint lawrence, flowing beneath the long<br />
road downhill towards the ferry<br />
tym quit playing around and let that cat go<br />
mind its own business, these are serious matters<br />
music and love, lost in unsettled memories<br />
prisoners to unkept adjectives<br />
im still waiting new york, i have nowhere else to be<br />
