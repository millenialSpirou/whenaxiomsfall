in the tent\\
silence finally became bliss\\
you could hear the streams\\
the frogs leaping and\\
what else were you supposed\\
to look for\\

she was on her back\\
he was on his side so as\\
to not miss a centimeter of it\\
there was no rain though he wished\\
to hear it s pearls\\
finding their own channels\\
