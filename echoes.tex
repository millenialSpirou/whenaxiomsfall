now i live in conditionned air territory\\
it used to be that distant echoes of craving\\
could nourrish loneliness with some depth of feeling\\
I had to put on my blue sweater \\
and turn the machine on\\

it rumbles smoothly, trying to concoct a lullaby\\
all I have are my memories of her's\\
the disjuncted ex's, whom i mesh in a fabric to sleep with\\
lay quietly under them, while the ill will whispers\\
tonight reality read from books sounds more concrete\\
more anchored, as if life prefers having some frame of reference\\
to circumscribe our confused airs of loneliness\\

If only I learned of the difference between inside \& outside\\
maybe, then, I could really lie next to you\\
always I thought I needed but so little\\
and here I am, wishing your presence, knowing I need it\\
yet should not, there are other ways tym they said\\
they are hard to find, I'll keep looking\\
