Its simple\\
you twist and turn\\
until it fits\\
well that sounds quite\\
unpleasant doesn't it\\
i didn't make the rules,\\
we measure trees by rings\\
I know but\\
then shutup why\\
can't you drop a knee and count\\
it s simple it really is\\
counting things tends to ruin them\\
haven't you heard, 
how the birds sing in the morning\\
when the wind is still slow and nice\\
when the ice doesn't melt but \\
just gently cracks beneath your feet\\
and when snow is something to be thankful for\\
