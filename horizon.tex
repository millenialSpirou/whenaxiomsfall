here the winds are clear\\
the flatness conjures something else\\
which cannot be fathomed;\\
the soft ripple of the stems\\
caress the horizons\\

fuzzyness is hard to define\\
yet you can feel it in empty mornings\\
we flash and yearn yet are bored\\
like Henry tym was lost between gripes\\
yet looked onwards towards fields\\
of yellow tranquil hills\\

do not go off chasing it\\
it will only leave you panting\\
tym needs to walk, resilience\\
hard stares and empty air\\
is where you'll find peace\\
was said before sometimes\\
