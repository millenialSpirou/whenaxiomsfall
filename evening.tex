evenings hit the hardest\\
when tym forgets at what time\\
the same old sun sets.\\
it slips by, eclipsed by the moon's signs\\
He just waits for a shadow\\
a silhouette of himself which is less shallow\\
you were there when it mattered\\
something must have shattered\\

actions are words when the\\
walls close in what else was tym left
with then words words and words\\
hinges don't have to hurt when\\
you fold your clothes; \& the day\\
was well spent\\

when it mattered I was chasing\\
instead of waiting, imitating --- \\
the tail never caught on to the trick\\
and now tym forgets the names of trees\\
