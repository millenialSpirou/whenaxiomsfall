tym went to his bed and looked for sleep\\
where there is none\\
as was foretold, but now think\\
why should it be there when you look\\
for the absence --\\
he opened a book; and threw it out\\

then another one\\
and the process went on\\
turning over maybe towards some\\
parallax of lost years\\
which; was fidgeting with his memory\\
when eyelids become the last\\
frontier of beauty,\\
rolling above restfulness\\
and so he remembered tom's advice\\

you need to stop fidgeting tym\\
it won't help no one\\
sit still and un-arch your back\\
focus on some task otherwise you know well;\\
in old age it will come back to haunt you\\
your posture I mean, lying down while the world wakes\\
can be often a cowardly act\\
