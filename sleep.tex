tym went to his bed and looked for sleep\\
where there is none\\
as was foretold\\
he opened a book\\
and threw it out\\

then another one\\
and the process went on\\
the parallax of lost years\\
was fidgeting with his memory\\
when eyelids become the last\\
frontier of beauty\\

you need to stop fidgeting tym\\
it won't help no one\\
sit still and un-arch your back\\
in old age it will come back to haunt you\\
your posture I mean
