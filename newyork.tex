Hello New York, I don't know if you'll\\
be reading this but I don't know how to wait\\
I feel certain a new me is growing inside the old one\\
and I'm not sure I have the bones to carry it\\
I visited you once, before tym was even born\\
walked the streets looking for cafes to read in\\

where are you new york, my bones are now\\
older than my skin, i know it\\
pillows stay attached to dreams of a long time ago\\
when we both rested to the same music\\
it still rings in my ear, the same chord\\
and the saint lawrence, flowing beneath the long\\
road downhill towards the ferry\\

tym quit playing around and let that cat go\\
mind its own business, these are serious matters\\
music and love, lost in unsettled memories\\
prisoners to unkept adjectives\\
im still waiting new york, i have nowhere else to be\\
