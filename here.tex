here we can see; the winds\\
carry nothing into grey bliss\\
pale blue is not the color\\
we had chosen but it is ours\\
before we can hear our cries\\
the post man delivers\\
the cats get lost in alleyways\\
as soon as doors open\\
they come back to lick\\
their paws\\
gently\\
because whoever was in a rush\\
was gravely mistaken\\

the winds are hollow\\
we had chosen others and;\\
they carry nothing but empty smiles\\
of old varnish, where are the \textcolor{pink}{colors}\\
are they too old to be told?\\
pale blue wasn't supposed to\\
be the one... at least it is cozy up there when\\
we can see the skies drifting\\

after we can see the limits\\
the employees punch in with weary eyes\\
discontent of their own desired cycles\\
and when they close doors\\
they don't double check the locks\\
because who would care\\
if one were to disappear\\
vanishing with hope\\
