Now you're laying asleep, content\\
with tamed eyes, absent from me\\
sheltered from me\\
they caressed your Hair\\
slipped the pill under your tongue\\
and whispered soft ``it's okay's''\\
here the windows are blurry with rain\\
glossing out construction cranes\\
--refracting the dying lights\\

The chairs were almost comfortable\\
and within their mutual angle\\
you only had to roll your eyes to\\
spray a distant stare\\
We used to have warm ashtrays\\
hot coffee,\\
cold feet; torn out socks\\
Scrambled eggs and ``fuck you weddings''\\
they caressed your hair\\
Slipped the pill under your tongue\\
and whispered their soft it's  okay's\\

You  should wake up and forget\\
but you slept remembering\\
they wear white coats\\
and indulgent airs\\
I will wear guilt and satisfation\\
when you woke up and remembered\\
I went for a long walk and you never came?
